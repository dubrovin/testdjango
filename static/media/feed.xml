<h4>Insights From The Designers:</h4>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Ever since the launch of our first 1000 flat icons, we received great feedback which encouraged us to further refine the icons, add more features, provide more formats and most importantly, produce many new icons. <strong>It is a true challenge</strong> attempting to cover all subjects and actions while trying to keep the illustrations simple enough to work as “icons” — a challenge we love!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve received requests for over 800 different icons and have now successfully produced 500 of them for our first update. New ideas keep arising, so bear with us and stay tuned!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you, dear <a href="http://roundicons.com/">Roundicons</a> team, for this fantastic icon set! We sincerely appreciate your time and efforts!</p>

<p>&#8220;April is the month of spring or autumn depending where you live on the globe! It&#8217;s also the second rainiest month of the year. I was inspired by one simple motif to illustrate rain, birds and flowers. So either you witness rainy days or colorful ones &#8230; Enjoy April!&#8221; &mdash; Designed by <a href="https://www.behance.net/ranakadry">Rana Kadry</a> from Egypt.</p>

<p>&#8220;April is a month associated with rainy days.  I enjoy photographing how the weather can change the perspective of everyday things.  On this rainy day, I captured the rain drops as they clung to my blue and pink polka dot umbrella.&#8221; &mdash; Designed by <a href="http://instagram.com/calypso13579#">Claire Scoufis</a> from Tampa, FL.</p>

<p>&#8220;The collection of birds are my travels. At each destination I buy a wood, bronze, stone bird, anything the local bazaars sell. I have all gathered at a modest vitrine in my house. I have so much loved my collection, that, after taking pictures of them I then designed each one, then created a wallpaper and overdressed a wall of my living room. Now my thought is making them as a desktop wallpaper and give them to you as a gift&#8221; &mdash; Designed by <a href="http://www.graphium.gr">Natasha Kamou</a> from Greece.</p>

<p>We’ve all been there, haven’t we? You find yourself in a coffee shop abroad, sipping cappuccino and chomping a muffin as you realize that your <strong>laptop’s battery charge</strong> is just about to crush your creative session to dust. Well, perhaps you’ve got your power adapter with you but, of course, it isn’t the right one for foreign power sockets.</p>
<p>So you end up looking around and chatting up with strangers asking for help. Some are more responsive than others, and before you know it, you don’t just have a full battery, but you&#8217;ve made a couple of new, surprisingly interesting acquaintances.</p>
<p>As it turns out, forgetting your power adapter is not only a great way to meet fantastic people but also a great strategy to come up with original ideas. In fact, this is exactly how the idea for the <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/27/smashing-mystery-riddle-have-you-figured-it-out-yet/">new Smashing Riddle</a> was born—in a coffee shop in Zürich, Switzerland—and yes, it was indeed that cinnamon muffin that made all the difference in the end.</p>
<h3>Letters Scattered All Over The Place, Like Muffin Crumbs</h3>
<p>Animations have a way of drawing attention to themselves. So it&#8217;s understandable that a vibrant animated GIF might raise some interest, questions, or perhaps the reasonable concern of friendly strangers. Desperately looking for a charger, I sparked a number of awkward conversations with surprisingly unsurprised, friendly strangers around me.</p>
<p>In the end, as the charger issue was successfully resolved, I found myself sitting behind a large wooden desk, immersed in a profound discussion with a charming, smart math student from Switzerland, and an eager, seasoned engineer from Turkey. It was a fast-paced, inspiring <strong>discussion about life stories, experiences, biggest failures and creative endeavours</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/muffin2.jpg" /><br /><em>This is how it all started. The letters scattered all over the GIFs were inspired by muffin crumbs scattered all over a plate. (Image source: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jentilley/6716370655/sizes/o/">jentilley</a>)</em></p>
<p>As the conversation continued—still sipping those Zürich cappucinos—I caught glimpses of one of the older animated GIFs looping on my screen, and before I knew it, the conversation was all about mysteries, riddles and mischievous animated GIFs. During an intensive, unscheduled, battery-recharge brainstorming session, we came up with a number of interesting ideas, all thoroughly written down, tagged and ready for use. One of the ideas was to <strong>play with the letters and the way they would be displayed</strong>.</p>
<p>You see, at SmashingMag, we cherish the idea of lasting traditions—be it monthly desktop wallpapers, editorial newsletters or those weird mystery riddles. So in the spirit of tradition, the riddle obviously had to be based on animated GIFs, but we wanted to do something entirely different from changing file names or guessing Twitter handles.</p>
<p>Originally, before my trip to Zürich, we had thought about using a number of invisible semi-transparent &#8220;layers&#8221; hidden in animated GIFs (erm, hey, we actually should do it for the next one!), and later on we spent quite some time prototyping the <em>&#8220;reflection&#8221;</em> idea in which a hidden message would be revealed once an actual mirror was placed up against the screen. The latter proved to be quite difficult later on in implementation, especially due to the wide diversity of screens out there.</p>
<p>During the brainstorming session, we came up with an idea to do <strong>something along the lines of Scrabble</strong>, so the readers would derive clues from a number of GIFs and construct a secret keyword out of the letters discovered in those GIFs. And what if <strong>letters were scattered all across the GIFs</strong> very much like the crumbs of the muffin were scattered all across my plate? Some letters could be hidden, others would be clearly visible, and all of them would be turned, or flipped, or rotated, or skewed for confusion—very much in the spirit of the &#8220;reflection&#8221; idea we had in the beginning. That&#8217;s one of the ideas I brought back to the office after my trip to Zürich.</p>
<h3>A New Mystery, A New Design Challenge</h3>
<p>Our previous mysteries required a lot of tinkering and experimentation but, frankly, quite a bit of luck as well. The most important bit was to come up with the right approach. For the new riddle, we wanted to keep things a bit simpler and apparently easier to draw in as many readers as possible without the riddle becoming too annoying after the first few tries.</p>
<p>Of course, the riddle shouldn’t be too easy either, so instead of hiding letters of one single word in GIFs, we felt that hiding parts of a sentence might work a bit better. <strong>We needed a twist though</strong>, something that would make the riddle a bit more interesting and cause one or two &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moments. We thought about using lowercase symbols to introduce more confusion but ‘i’ and ‘l’ might look too similar in a small resolution, so instead we looked specifically for <strong>letters that could be confusing</strong> and decided to rotate them or skew them until they actually <em>become</em> confusing. It wasn’t the only twist though, as you’ll see later in the article—a few fine adjustments and twists were added during the test phase later on.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/scene1.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mystery-setting.jpg" /></a><br /><em>Whenever a new mystery is created, the first thing we do is set up the scene for the riddle. Our dear animator Guillaume knows exactly how to create just the right atmosphere. An early draft. (<a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/scene1.jpg">Large preview)</a></em></p>
<p>So when Paul Boag’s <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/books/#digital-adaptation">new book</a> was about to be published, we jumped right into the idea, came up with a sentence and <strong>scattered parts of that sentence across three animated GIFs</strong>. Each GIF contained a few scattered letters (all uppercase) that readers were supposed to use to build words. Once you put the words from all the GIFs together, you’d be able to create a sentence—and, of course, no letters should be left unused. So once the sentence is constructed, it had to be tweeted <code>@smashingmag</code> using the hashtag <code>#smashing</code>. Of course, we’d also hidden a few clues in the image captions under each animation and in the corresponding file names.</p>
<p>Easy-peasy? Well, let’s see how it works, and what hidden clues those weird animations contain. (But seriously, who would put skewed letters on the floor and walls anyway, right?)</p>
<h3>1. &#8220;Change&#8221;: Get Out Of That Desk Already</h3>
<p>You know it, and we know it: nothing is more frustrating than stubborn management. Usually, changing workflows, processes and culture seems to be impossible, but perhaps something can be done about it after all. At least if you trust the hint provided for the very first animated GIF.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Smashing Book Mystery" src="http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/mystery-digital-adaptation/change.gif" style="max-width: 100% !important" /><br /><em style="display: inline-block; max-width: 500px;">Nothing is more frustrating than stubborn management. Perhaps it&#8217;s just about time to do something about it. Three words, one of them on the floor. (<a href="http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/mystery-digital-adaptation/change.gif">Large preview)</a></em></p>
<p>Well, if you are playing Scrabble or any other word-building game, the first thing you have to do is gather everything you’ve gotc. So alright, we have to find three words in the GIF. Let’s collect the letters first, starting from the left-bottom corner:</p>
<pre>TCRIEZDOU</pre>
<p>Alright. Well, we are smart, so why don’t we just use an <a href="http://wordfinder.yourdictionary.com/unscramble/">online anagram solver</a> to make the sense of these letters? We don’t want to do it manually, right? <a href="http://wordfinder.yourdictionary.com/unscramble/TCRIEZDOU">Hmmmm.</a> No result. It doesn’t make sense. That’s weird. There must be a trap. Perhaps we are missing something: we could argue about &#8220;O&#8221;, if it&#8217;s actually the letter &#8216;O&#8217; or the digit &#8217;0&#8242;, but apparently we can rule out digits since all characters are supposed to be uppercase letters. But wait a second: if you rotate &#8220;Z&#8221; through 90 degrees, you end up with an &#8220;N&#8221;, right? So perhaps the combination is different:</p>
<pre>TCRIENDOU</pre>
<p>Ah, that’s better. Looks more like English. We’d better watch out for those traps. Okay, if we play around with it, we can figure out that the word hidden here is… <code>NORDIC TEU</code>, erm, <code>TCRIONDUCE</code>, er… aha! <code>INTRODUCE</code>! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTMvNZ8WeIU">Nailed it.</a></p>
<p>Okay, it wasn&#8217;t too hard. So what about the two missing words? Same game, same rules. Let’s collect the letters first:</p>
<pre>INTRODUCE HCANEGDATIGIL-=</pre>
<p>Mmm. Wait, wait. Only letters are allowed, so the yellow sticky notes with an equals sign and the dash are probably another trap since only uppercase letters have to be considered. We can remove them:</p>
<pre>INTRODUCE HCANEGDATIGIL</pre>
<p>Okay, it smells… easy. Probably the best way to avoid mistakes in discovering the words is to move letters around until they start making sense, probably with <code>CMD+X</code> and <code>CMD+V</code>. Right, right. The shiny new book on the table can’t just sit there on its own—what’s the title again? <em>Digital Adaptation.</em> Ah wait; wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;DIGITAL&#8221; fit nicely here, and in fact, the letters are right there, aren&#8217;t they?</p>
<pre>INTRODUCE DIGITAL HCANEG</pre>
<p>Well, it’s time to do something about that frustration, right? Probably just the right time for a… <em>change?</em></p>
<pre>INTRODUCE DIGITAL CHANGE</pre>
<p><a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/xcIZEJ2dxnOz6">Bingo!</a> Well, at this point we know that every animated GIF contains a couple of words, but it looks like they might be connected on their own as well. We <em>might</em> try to distribute the letters in an other way, but this solution does look quite fitting. Okay, let’s hope for the best and move to the next one.</p>
<h3>2. &#8220;Convincing&#8221;: They Listen But Don’t Move</h3>
<p>Well, perhaps you still have the enthusiasm to convince your colleagues about a more pragmatic, effective workflow. But is it really usually colleagues who need this kind of convincing?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Smashing Book Mystery" src="http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/mystery-digital-adaptation/convincing.gif" style="max-width: 100% !important" /><br /><em style="display: inline-block; max-width: 500px !important;">It&#8217;s difficult to convince them, though. But if not you, who else will help the company and bring it on the right path? Three words. (<a href="http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/mystery-digital-adaptation/convincing.gif">Large preview)</a></em></p>
<p>Oh well, at least it looks like those people in the meeting are paying attention to what that guy is so passionately explaining. Again, let’s collect the letters scattered over the table first, and we should keep the variations in mind as well: &#8220;M&#8221; could be a &#8220;W&#8221; and &#8220;Z&#8221; could be an &#8220;N&#8221;, and &#8220;L&#8221; in left upper corner looks surprisingly similar to a skewed &#8220;J&#8221; (by design or by mistake?). So we’ve got:</p>
<pre>AHP[L/J]EEA[M/W][Z/N]ETG[N/Z]</pre>
<p>Oh wait, there is another one, in the upper left corner under the plant! Is it &#8220;M&#8221; or &#8220;W&#8221;? Let&#8217;s consider both options. Okay, that’s freaky:</p>
<pre>AHP[L/J]EEA[M/W][Z/N]ETG[N/Z][M/W]</pre>
<p>That’s quite a few combinations. We <em>must</em> be smarter about this. Let’s look at the image caption. The caption talks about &#8220;convincing them&#8221;, but what does it refer to? Ah, stubborn management from the first GIF. Perhaps the guy in the GIF is trying to convince… <code>managers</code>?</p>
<pre>MANAGE HP[L/J]EET[N/Z][M/W]</pre>
<p>Umm… almost. So we have neither &#8220;R&#8221; nor &#8220;S&#8221; here, so what else could it be? Ah! Perhaps <code>management</code>?</p>
<pre>MANAGEMENT HP[L/J]E</pre>
<p>Nice! Well, there aren’t many four-letter-words with &#8220;H&#8221;, &#8220;P&#8221; and &#8220;J&#8221;, so we probably should stick with the &#8220;L&#8221;. Could it be&#8230; <code>HPLE</code>, or to be more precise, <code>HELP</code>. Well, it sounds about right, especially since &#8220;help&#8221; is also mentioned in the image caption to that GIF.</p>
<pre>MANAGEMENT HELP</pre>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/invisible-a.jpg" width="500" height="396" alt="Invisible A" style="max-width: 450px !important; border-radius: 8px;" /><br /><em> The &#8220;A&#8221; was hidden fairly well in the pie chart on the presentation wall, wasn’t it?</em></p>
<p>Good, good, it wasn’t too difficult after all. Oh snap. It was supposed to be three words. Did we miss something? Let&#8217;s take a closer look around the room again. The presentation chart has a few graphs on it, doesn&#8217;t it? Circles, bars, a pie&#8230; but that pie, there&#8217;s something suspicious about it! Doesn&#8217;t the piece of the pie look like an &#8220;A&#8221;? An invisible &#8220;A&#8221;, maybe? Well, it is&#8230;</p>
<pre>MANAGEMENT HELP A</pre>
<p>Alright! That&#8217;s a long shot, but let&#8217;s go with it for now, and let’s proceed with the last one.</p>
<h3>3. &#8220;Difference&#8221;: It’s Going To Be Just Fine</h3>
<p>Alright, we know how it works by now. Look closely everywhere on the image and gather all the letters first: that means looking on the carpet, under the chair and under the plant. And then double-check everything to make sure that we don’t miss anything. Also, we know that we can’t trust the colours and the position of letters, they didn’t help us in the past but instead confused (and annoyed) us a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Smashing Book Mystery" src="http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/mystery-digital-adaptation/difference.gif" style="max-width: 100% !important" /><br /><em style="display: inline-block; max-width: 500px;">In fact, you&#8217;ve got nothing to lose. And who knows, in the end, it might turn out even better than you expected. Four words. The letters on the floor belong together, in one word. (<a href="http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/mystery-digital-adaptation/difference.gif">Large preview)</a></em></p>
<p>We know that the words on the floor belong together, in one word. Let’s start with them:</p>
<pre>ARE</pre>
<p>Oh well, there aren’t too many options here: it could be either &#8220;ERA&#8221; or &#8220;ARE&#8221;. Could it be that easy? Well, let’s keep it this way for now, and gather all the other letters, from the left to the right:</p>
<pre>HEFRE[M/W]KCTDE[N/Z]FIEEA</pre>
<p>And we have something that appears to be a blank piece of paper. What’s that thing now? An invisible character? Or a sign that a character is hidden? Or an empty space? Also, could something be hidden under the book, or behind the picture, or on the other side of the chair? OK, OK, let’s not get paranoid here. Deep breath. So we’ve got three words to figure out here.</p>
<p>Well, it might take a while, so let’s watch out for clues. The guy in the chair seems to have it all figured out. Perhaps we should check the larger preview of the image. Oh snap, its file name is… <code>difference.gif</code>. Is it… could it be…?</p>
<pre>DIFFERENCE H[M/W]KTEEA</pre>
<p>OK, this sounds about right. The combination of available unused letters doesn’t leave <em>that</em> many options: <code>WEH KTEA</code>, <code>MATE HKE</code>… Hmmm. Well, since the character in the chair is victorious, and it’s all about difference, perhaps he… made it?</p>
<pre>DIFFERENCE MAKE HTE</pre>
<p>Better! We’re almost there:</p>
<pre>[ERA/ARE] DIFFERENCE MAKE THE</pre>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/invisible-l-thumbs-up.jpg" width="500" height="343" alt="Invisible L" style="border-radius: 8px; max-width: 450px !important;" /><br /><em>Sometimes thumbs-up could mean more than a sign of appreciation. The invisible &#8220;L&#8221; that was missing to turn &#8220;REA&#8221; into the word &#8220;REAL&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Phew, now, that was quite a journey! But wait a second! That guy passing by, giving a thumbs-up to the character in the chair… Doesn’t it look like an &#8220;L&#8221;? The image caption says that the words on the floor belong together, but it doesn’t say that they build up an <em>entire word</em>. Well, if we added &#8220;L&#8221; to [ERA/ARE]… Oh:</p>
<pre>REAL</pre>
<p>&#8220;REAL&#8221;! So perhaps it&#8217;s about making a real difference in the end. OK, let’s keep it in mind for now.</p>
<p>Yes, of course, there might be many solutions and we would accept all of them if all letters were used, but after 45 minutes of collaborative brainstorming we discovered that it was highly unlikely that you could construct an entirely different, perfectly meaningful sentence by using all letters scattered across the GIFs, leaving no letters unused. Now it’s time to bring all these words together and try to construct something more or less meaningful out of it.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Solution&#8221;: Making Sense Of It All</h3>
<pre>
INTRODUCE DIGITAL CHANGE
MANAGEMENT HELP A
DIFFERENCE MAKE THE [ERA/ARE/REAL]</pre>
<p>Okay, well, it doesn’t look too scary! It’s probably as easy as something along the lines of &#8220;Help the management introduce digital change: make real difference.&#8221; In fact, yes, we would accept all solutions which include &#8220;ERA&#8221; and &#8220;ARE&#8221;, but a sentence shouldn’t be just a loose pile of unconnected words. These are all the options which you could build out of this mess of letters:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/livlab/status/449228483651457027"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/solving-riddle.jpg" style="border-radius: 8px;" /></a><br /><em><a href="https://twitter.com/livlab/status/449228483651457027">Livia Labate</a> is one of the solvers of the riddle. Yep, it was a bit of work indeed.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Help the management introduce digital change: make a real difference.</li>
<li>Help management make the difference. Introduce digital. Change era.</li>
<li>Digital era: introduce a change, help management, make the difference.</li>
<li>Manage digital era change, introduce a plan, make the difference.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So here we are.</strong> A little journey from muffin crumbs to letters scattered all over the place, shady characters and a few invisible characters. Time to reveal and reward the winners.</p>
<h3>Winners!</h4>
<p>It’s showtime! Surprisingly to us, the <strong>riddle didn’t take much less time to resolve than the previous ones</strong>. First place was earned by the person who was quickest <em>and</em> the closest to solving the riddle, i.e. have found all the right words in the riddle and leaving no letters unused. Please notice that since nobody discovered the &#8220;REAL&#8221; bit, we had to relax the rules a little. We raffled the other prizes across the first people who tweeted a correct sentence, and tried our best to exclude copycats. The winners can select any prize of their choice (be it a bag, a Smashing Library account, printed books or anything else). And they all get the Smashing Cody Stress-Relief Ball, too. All winners have been contacted.</p>
<p>The first perfectly correct sentence with no letters left unused was tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/dorinmoise/status/449185381544910848">Dorin Moise</a> from Brussels, Belgium, <strong>one hour and five minutes after the mystery went live</strong>, with: &#8220;there, make a difference: help management introduce digital change.&#8221; It&#8217;s not quite correct but it was the fastest and the most precise tweet. Congratulations, Dorin! You just won a roundtrip to our lovely hometown Freiburg for the Smashing Conference Freiburg, a stay in a fancy hotel and a few Smashing Books. Yaaay!</p>

<h3>Behind The Scenes</h3>
<!-- deleted style tag -->
<p class="designer"><img style="border-radius: 8px;" alt="Guillaume Kurdjian" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/guillaume.jpg" /><br />
<em><a href="http://guillaumekurkdjian.com/">Guillaume Kurdjian</a> is a 22-year-old freelance illustrator and animator from Nantes, France. Guillaume likes to experiment with stuff on his computer and climb trees.</em></p>
<p>Just like the last two times, we worked with talented <a href="http://guillaumekurkdjian.com/">Guillaume Kurdjian</a> on a series of <a href="http://bisouslescopains.tumblr.com/">animated GIFs</a> for the riddle. This time the discussion thread was a bit shorter, and after thorough conversations and prototypes, we ended up with quite a number of different GIFs, drafts, and ideas that were thrown away, as well as the ones that made it to the final stage.</p>
<p>All designs were a <strong>series of iterations</strong> to make the overall riddle not necessarily perfect, but just right. So a big “thank you!” to Guillaume for following through and being so enthusiastic and kind about all the changes made.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/make-the-difference.gif"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/make-the-difference.gif" /></a><br /><em>Ah, it is a great feeling to solve that damn riddle, isn&#8217;t it? Well, you don&#8217;t really make the difference, but it&#8217;s pretty, pretty good nevertheless. (<a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/make-the-difference.gif">Large preview)</a></em></p>
<p>As it always is with a public hashtag, it can be quite difficult to separate between the &#8220;real&#8221; tweets and copies of the tweets. We didn’t choose the hashtag <code>#smashing</code> by accident since it is a quite &#8220;messy&#8221; hashtag on Twitter, but it wasn’t good enough since we saw lots of weird activities going on, with people reusing tweets 1:1 which we of course didn&#8217;t accept. We did look very closely at the dates and profile and activities of every winner to <strong>prevent copycats from winning</strong>. (We probably will go with <code>#cats</code> next time or even better—will challenge <em>you</em> to construct the &#8220;right&#8221; hashtag on your own).</p>

<p>The first GIF wasn’t really a problem for anyone. However, for some weird reason the word &#8220;convincing&#8221; started to pop up in tweets, although the letter &#8220;V&#8221; didn&#8217;t make its public appearance anywhere—in neither of all those GIFs. Quite a <a href="https://twitter.com/loveliveloudoun/status/449326884841848832">number</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ianwinter/status/449235796881842176">of readers</a> discovered &#8220;game plan&#8221; in the second GIF and was confused about the number of words that would be hidden in the second GIF if &#8220;game plan&#8221; actually was hidden there.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://twitter.com/tuskali/status/449227808221700096"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/tuukka.png" style="border-radius: 8px;" /></a><br /><em><a href="http://wordsmith.org/">Wordsmith</a> encountered server hiccups 30 minutes after the riddle went live, but of course we don’t take any responsibility for it.</em></p>
<p>The truth is that &#8220;game plan&#8221; wasn’t the part of our initial plan, so we take no responsibility for massive headaches or confusion caused—<em>sorry about that!</em>. Also, apparently <a href="http://wordsmith.org/">Wordsmith</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/tuskali/status/449227808221700096">encountered server hiccups</a> 30 minutes after the riddle went live, but of course we don’t take any responsibility for it either.</p>

<p>The most trouble was caused by the second GIF which caused quite a lot of headache for many readers. You could go as far as trying to decode the movements of the animated character who could be using semaphore, a marine alphabet. This wasn&#8217;t the plan either.</p>

<p>In 1910, psychologist <a href="http://www.leonardo.info/isast/articles/behrens.html">Max Wertheimer had an insight</a> when he observed a series of lights flashing on and off at a railroad crossing. It was similar to how the lights encircling a movie theater marquee flash on and off. </p>
<p>To the observer, it appears as if a single light moves around the marquee, traveling from bulb to bulb, when in reality it&#8217;s a series of bulbs turning on and off and the lights don&#8217;t move it all.</p>
<p>This observation led to a set of descriptive principles about how we visually perceive objects. These principles sit at the heart of nearly everything we do graphically as designers.</p>
<p>This is the start of a series of posts about design principles. It begins with these <a href="http://www.vanseodesign.com/web-design/gestalt-principles-of-perception/">principles of gestalt</a>, because <strong>many of the design principles we follow arise out of gestalt theory</strong>. In this post, I&#8217;ll walk you through a little bit of theory and offer some basic definitions of gestalt principles.</p>
<p>Future posts in this series will consider aspects of design like space, balance and visual hierarchy. In upcoming posts, I&#8217;ll point out which gestalt principles influence the aspects of design being discussed, and I&#8217;ll offer more practical uses and examples of how the gestalt principles are used in Web design.
</p>
<h3>The Key Ideas Behind Gestalt Theory</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The whole is other than the sum of the parts.&rdquo;<br />
&mdash; Kurt Koffka</p></blockquote>
<p>The quote above is gestalt in a nutshell. When human beings see a group of objects, we perceive their entirety before we see the individual objects. We see the whole as more than the sum of the parts, and even when the parts are entirely separate entities, we&#8217;ll look to group them as some whole.</p>
<p>There are several <a href="http://cct370-w07.wikispaces.com/Gestalt+%28Properties+and+Laws%29">key ideas behind gestalt</a>:</p>
<ul>
<p>
<li><strong>Emergence (the whole is identified before the parts)</strong><br/>Emergence is the process of forming complex patterns from simple rules. When attempting to identify an object, we first seek to identify its outline. We then match this outline pattern against shapes and objects we already know to find a match. Only after the whole emerges through this outline pattern matching, do we start to identify the parts that make up the whole.<br/><br />
When designing, keep in mind that people will identify elements first by their general form. A simple well defined object will communicate more quickly than a detailed object with a hard to recognize contour.</li>
<li><strong>Reification (our mind fills in the gaps)</strong><br/>Reification is an aspect of perception in which the object as perceived contains more spatial information than what is actually present. As we attempt to match what we see to the familiar patterns we have stored in memory, there isn&#8217;t always an exact match. Instead we find a near match and then fill in the gaps of what we think we should see.<br/><br />
Reification suggests that we don&#8217;t need to present the complete outline in order of viewers to see it. We can leave out parts of the outline as long as we provide enough of it to allow for a close enough pattern match. You can see examples of this a little further down under the principle of closure.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-stability (the mind seeks to avoid uncertainty)</strong></br/>Multi-stability is the tendency of ambiguous perceptual experiences to move unstably back and forth between alternative interpretations. Some objects can be perceived in more than one way. An example from below in the section of figure/ground is one you&#8217;ve likely seen before. The image can be seen as either two faces in profile or as a vase.<br/><br />
You can&#8217;t see both at once. Instead you bounce back and forth quickly between the two stable alternatives. One will tend to be your dominant perception and the longer you go without begin able to see the other, the harder it will be to see that other perception.<br/><br />
From a design perspective if you want to change someone&#8217;s perception, don&#8217;t try to change it all at once. Find a way to get them to see an alternative. Then work to strengthen that alternative view, while weakening the original.</li>
<li><strong>Invariance (we&#8217;re good at recognizing similarities and differences)</strong><br/>Invariance is a property of perception in which simple objects are recognized independent of their rotation, translation and scale. Since we often encounter objects from different perspectives, we&#8217;ve developed an ability to recognize them despite their different appearance.<br/><br />
Imagine if you could only recognize someone you knew if they stood directly in front of you and faced you, but you couldn&#8217;t recognize them once they turned in profile. Despite the different visual perspective we can still recognize people.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see these ideas in play in the principles below. The main idea is that <a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/perception/gestalt/gestalt.htm">gestalt principles are about perception</a> and what is visually communicated by objects. The principles speak to the core of the visual language within which we work.</p>
<h3>Gestalt Principles</h3>
<p>Most of the principles are relatively easy to understand. There&#8217;s a common theme running through many of them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All else being equal, elements that are related by X tend to be grouped perceptually into higher-order units.&rdquo;<br />
&mdash; Stephen Palmer</p></blockquote>
<p>Many of the principles below will follow this pattern. The principles either define X or the higher order that&#8217;s perceived.</p>
<h4>Law of Pr&auml;gnanz (Good Figure, Law of Simplicity)</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form(s) possible.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the fundamental principle of gestalt. We prefer things that are simple, clear and ordered. Instinctually these things are safer. They take less time for us to process and present less dangerous surprises.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/01-pragnanz.png" alt="Law of Prägnanz (Good Figure, Law of Simplicity)." title="Law of Prägnanz (Good Figure, Law of Simplicity)." width="500" height="201" /><br /><em>Law of Pr&auml;gnanz (Good Figure, Law of Simplicity).</em></p>
<p>When confronted with complex shapes, we tend to reorganize them into simpler components or into a simpler whole. You&#8217;re more likely to see the left image above composed of the simple circle, square and triangle like you see on the right than as the the complex and ambiguous shape the whole forms.</p>
<p>In this case, seeing three distinct objects is simpler than seeing one complex object. In other cases, it&#8217;s simpler to see a single object, which brings us to&hellip;</p>
<h4>Closure</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When seeing a complex arrangement of elements, we tend to look for a single, recognizable pattern.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>As with Pr&auml;gnanz, closure seeks simplicity. Closure is the opposite of what we saw in the Pr&auml;gnanz image above where three objects were simpler than one. With closure, we instead combine parts to form a simpler whole. Our eye fills in the missing information to form the complete figure.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/02-closure.png" alt="Closure." title="Closure." width="500" height="250" /><br /><em>Closure.</em></p>
<p>In the left image above, you should see a white triangle even though the image is actually comprised of three black Pac-Man-like shapes. On the right image, you see a panda even though the figure is several random shapes. Seeing the triangle and panda is simpler than trying to make sense of the individual parts.</p>
<p>Closure can be thought of as the glue holding elements together. It&#8217;s about the human tendency to seek and find patterns.</p>
<p>The key to closure is providing enough information so the eye can fill in the rest. If too much is missing, the elements will be seen as separate parts instead of a whole. If too much information is provided, there&#8217;s no need for closure to occur.</p>
<h4>Symmetry and Order</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;People tend to perceive objects as symmetrical shapes that form around their center.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Symmetry gives us a feeling of solidity and order, which we tend to seek. It&#8217;s our nature to impose order on chaos. This principle leads us to want balance in composition, though our compositions don&#8217;t need to be perfectly symmetrical to be in balance.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/03-symmetry.png" alt="Symmetry and Order." title="Symmetry and Order." width="500" height="166" /><br /><em>Symmetry and Order.</em></p>
<p>In the image above, you should see three pairs of opening and closing brackets. The principle of proximity, which we&#8217;ll get to later in this post, might suggest we should see something else. That suggests symmetry takes precedence over proximity.</p>
<p>Since our eyes will quickly find symmetry and order, these principles can be used to effectively communicate information quickly.</p>
<h4>Figure/Ground</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Elements are perceived as either figure (the element in focus) or ground (the background on which the figure rests).&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Figure/ground refers to the relationship between positive elements and negative space. The idea is that the eye will separate whole figures from their background in order to understand what&#8217;s being seen. It&#8217;s one of the first things people will do when looking at any composition.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/04-figure-ground.png" alt="Figure/Ground." title="Figure/Ground." width="500" height="245"/><br /><em>Figure and Ground.</em></p>
<p>The figure/ground relationship can be either stable or unstable depending on how easy it is to determine which is which. The classic example of where the relationship is unstable is the left image above. You either see a vase or two faces depending on whether you see the black color as figure and the white as ground, or vice versa. That you can easily bounce back and forth between the two perceptions demonstrates the unstable relationship.</p>
<p>The more stable the relationship, the better we can lead our audience to focus on what we want them to see. Two related principles can help us:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Area</strong><br />
	The smaller of two overlapping objects is seen as figure. The larger is seen as ground. You can see this in the right image above.  The smaller shape is the figure regardless of color.</li>
<li><strong>Convexity</strong><br />
	Convex rather than concave patterns tend to be perceived as figures.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Uniform Connectedness</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the image below, lines connect two pairs of elements. This connection leads us to perceive that the connected elements are related to each other in some way.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/05-uniform-connectedness.png" alt="Uniform Connectedness" title="Uniform Connectedness" width="500" height="382" /><br /><em>Uniform Connectedness.</em></p>
<p>Of all the principles suggesting objects are related, uniform connectedness is the strongest. In the image above, even though we see two squares and two circles, we see the square&ndash;circle pairs as more strongly related because they are visually connected.</p>
<p>Notice that the lines don&#8217;t need to touch the elements for the connection to be perceived.</p>
<h4>Common Regions</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Elements are perceived as part of a group if they are located within the same closed region.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Another way to show a connection between elements is to enclose them in some way. Everything inside the enclosure is seen as related. Everything outside the encloser is seen as separate. The circles in the image below are all the same, yet we see two distinct groups, with the circles in each enclosure related in some way.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/06-common-regions.png" alt="Common Regions." title="Common Regions." width="500" height="215" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-184249" /><br /><em>Common Regions.</em></p>
<p>The typical way to show a common region is to draw a box around the related elements like I&#8217;ve done above. Placing the elements on a different background color than their immediate surroundings will also work.</p>
<h4>Proximity</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Objects that are closer together are perceived as more related than objects that are further apart.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Proximity is similar to common regions but uses space as the enclosure. When elements are positioned close to one another, they are seen as part of a group rather than as individual elements. This is especially true when the elements in the group are closer to each other than they are to any elements outside the group.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/07-proximity.png" alt="Proximity." title="Proximity." width="500" height="214" /><br /><em>Proximity.</em></p>
<p>The objects don&#8217;t need to be similar in any other way beyond being grouped near each other in space in order to be seen as having a proximity relationship.</p>
<h4>Continuation</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Elements arranged on a line or curve are perceived as more related than elements not on the line or curve.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s instinct to follow a river, a path or a fence line.  Once you look or move in a particular direction, you continue to look or move in that direction until you see something significant or you determine there&#8217;s nothing significant to see.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/08-continuation.png" alt="Continuation." title="Continuation." width="500" height="256" /><br /><em>Continuation.</em></p>
<p>Another interpretation of this principle is that we&#8217;ll continue our perception of shapes beyond their ending points. In the image above, we see a line and curve crossing instead of four distinct line and curve segments that meet at a single point.</p>
<h4>Common Fate (Synchrony)</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Elements that move in the same direction are perceived as more related than elements that are stationary or that move in different directions.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Regardless of how far apart the elements are placed or how dissimilar they appear, if they are seen as moving or changing together, they&#8217;ll be perceived as being related.</p>
<p>The elements don&#8217;t need to be moving for the principle of common fate to be present. It&#8217;s more that they are seen as having a common destination. For example, if four people are clustered together, but two are observed heading toward the right, they will be seen as having a common fate. Even if two are only <em>looking</em> in the same direction, they&#8217;ll be perceived as having a common fate.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/09-common-fate.png" alt="Common Fate (Synchrony)." title="Common Fate (Synchrony)." width="500" height="213" /><br /><em>Common Fate (Synchrony).</em></p>
<p>In the image above, the arrows are enough to indicate the elements share a common fate. While movement or change isn&#8217;t necessary, both are still a stronger indication of common fate than things like arrows or looking in the same direction which only imply movement.</p>
<h4>Parallelism</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Elements that are parallel to each other are seen as more related than elements not parallel to each other.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>This principle is similar to the common fate principle above. Lines are often interpreted as pointing or moving in some direction. Parallel lines are seen as either pointing or moving in the same direction and are thus related.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/10-parallelism.png" alt="Parallelism." title="Parallelism." width="500" height="349" /><br /><em>Parallelism.</em></p>
<p>It should be noted that for parallelism to be perceived, the lines can also be curves or shapes, though with the latter the shapes should be somewhat line-like in order for them to appear parallel.</p>
<h4>Similarity</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Elements that share similar characteristics are perceived as more related than elements that don&#8217;t share those characteristics.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Any number of characteristics can be similar: color, shape, size, texture, etc. When a viewer sees these similar characteristics, they perceive the elements as being related due to the shared characteristics.</p>
<p>In the image below, red circles are seen as related to the other red circles and black circles to black circles due to the similarity in color. Red and black circles are seen as dissimilar to each other even though they&#8217;re all circles.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/11-similarity.png" alt="Similarity." title="Similarity." width="500" height="221" /><br /><em>Similarity.</em></p>
<p>An obvious place to find similarity online is in the color of links. Typically, links within content will be styled the same way, often blue and underlined. This lets the viewer know that the different pieces of text are related. Once one is discovered to be a link, it communicates the others are also links.</p>
<h4>Focal Points</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Elements with a point of interest, emphasis or difference will capture and hold the viewer’s attention.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>This principle suggests that our attention will be drawn toward contrast, toward the element that is unlike the others in some way. In the image below, your eye should be drawn to the square. It&#8217;s a different shape and color from the other elements. I&#8217;ve also given it a drop shadow to further emphasize it.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/12-focal-point.png" alt="Focal Points." title="Focal Points." width="500" height="281" /><br /><em>Focal Points.</em></p>
<p>The principle of focal points likely arises out of our need to quickly identify the unknown to alert us to potential danger.</p>
<p>The principles of similarity and focal points are connected, and focal points can&#8217;t be seen without the presence of similarity among other elements.</p>
<h4>Past Experiences</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Elements tend to be perceived according to an observer&#8217;s past experience.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Past experience is perhaps the weakest gestalt principle. In conjunction with any of the other principles, the other principle will dominate over the past experience principle.</p>
<p>Past experience is unique to the individual, so it&#8217;s difficult to make assumptions about how it will be perceived. However, there are common experiences we all share. For example, a lot of color meaning arises out of past experience.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/13-past-experience.png" alt="Past Experiences." title="Past Experience." width="500" height="284" /><br /><em>Past Experiences.</em></p>
<p>Having seen traffic lights throughout our lives, we expect red to mean stop and green to mean go. You probably see the image above as a traffic light on its side, because of the three common colors. That&#8217;s past experience at work.</p>
<p>Many of our common experiences also tend to be cultural. Color again provides examples. In some countries, white is seen as pure and innocent and black as evil and death. In other countries, these interpretations are reversed. Conventions can arise when the experience is commonly shared, though again it&#8217;s important to remember that we don&#8217;t all share the same experiences.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Gestalt principles are important to understand. They sit at the foundation of everything we do visually as designers. They describe how everyone visually perceives objects.</p>
<p>The principles above should be relatively easy to understand. For most of them, the definition and the image are probably all you needed to understand the principle. At the same time, understanding the basic ideas of these principles isn&#8217;t the same as understanding how they influence design.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks we&#8217;ll look more at how gestalt influences design. We&#8217;ll see how symmetry helps us balance a composition and  how combining focal points and similarity allows us to create a visual hierarchy in a design.</p>
<p>Before we get to either, though, we&#8217;ll take a deeper look at the figure/ground relationship and consider the space in which we place elements. That&#8217;s where I&#8217;ll pick up the series.</p>

<p>By now, you might actually know how it works. The good ol&#8217; Smashing Mysteries: <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-book-mystery-is-resolved-gifs-crazy-people-all-that-malarkey/">the door that would never open</a> and <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-mystery-resolved-the-rain-that-never-stops-frightened-cats-cake-is-a-lie/">the rain that would never stop</a>. Well, the Mystery continues! To celebrate the launch of Paul Boag&#8217;s <em>Digital Adaptation</em> book, we’ve prepared a new riddle, and this time it&#8217;s a bit different and a bit easier.</p>
<p>How does it work? Below you&#8217;ll find <strong>three animated GIFs that contain a hidden message</strong>. Each GIF contains a few scattered letters (all uppercase) that you can use to build words. Once you put the words from all the GIFs together, you will be able to create a sentence. Please notice that no letters should be left unused. Once you&#8217;ve resolved the mystery, please tweet the full sentence <code>@smashingmag</code> using the hashtag <code>#smashing</code>.</p>
<h4>Are you ready? Action!</h4>
<p>Watch out for the clues in the descriptions under each animation. Remember: <strong>the key is to build one meaningful sentence out of the words</strong> scattered all across the GIFs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Smashing Book Mystery" src="http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/mystery-digital-adaptation/change.gif" style="max-width: 100% !important" /><br /><em style="display: inline-block; max-width: 500px;">Nothing is more frustrating than stubborn management. Perhaps it&#8217;s just about time to do something about it. 3 words, 1 of them on the floor. <a href="http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/mystery-digital-adaptation/change.gif">Large preview.</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Smashing Book Mystery" src="http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/mystery-digital-adaptation/convincing.gif" style="max-width: 100% !important" /><br /><em style="display: inline-block; max-width: 500px;">It&#8217;s difficult to convince them though. But if not you, who else will help the company and bring it on the right path? 3 words. <a href="http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/mystery-digital-adaptation/convincing.gif">Large preview.</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Smashing Book Mystery" src="http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/mystery-digital-adaptation/difference.gif" style="max-width: 100% !important" /><br /><em style="display: inline-block; max-width: 500px;">In fact, you&#8217;ve got nothing to lose. And who knows, in the end, it might turn out even better than you expected. 4 words. The letters on the floor belong together, in one word. <a href="http://provide.smashingmagazine.com/mystery-digital-adaptation/difference.gif">Large preview.</a></em></p>
<h3>What Can You Win?</h3>
<p>Among the first readers who tweet the sentence with the hashtag <code>#smashing</code>, we&#8217;ll raffle a quite extraordinary, <em>smashing</em> prize (and a couple of other Smashing extras):</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>roundtrip flight to Freiburg, Germany</strong>,</li>

Their systems, processes, and (in many cases) people are not configured to support it. In this chapter, Paul discusses warning signs of digital incompatibility in your company, organizational and cultural barriers and changes that the new digital landscape has brought. This is a chapter of how most organizations struggle with their digital strategy and what you have to know to avoid the problems in a long run.</p>

<p>When I gave <a href="http://smashingconf.com/speakers/andrew-clarke">this talk</a> a title, I called it “A Modern Designer’s Canvas,” because originally I was going to talk about the tools and processes that I use when I’m designing. But being a good designer or developer is about so much more than knowing how to use tools. It’s also about the way we approach what we do and our attitude towards it.</p>
<p>I’m going to talk about <strong>four lessons that can help us do what we do better</strong>. These have been important to me, especially over the last challenging few years, when how we make websites has changed so much. They’re lessons that I learned a long time ago, at art school:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a medium that expresses your interests and talents.</li>
<li>Don’t get intoxicated by a process or fall in love with tools.</li>
<li>Challenge what you’re told, including what you’ve heard at conferences and in articles.</li>
<li>Beat your own path, rather than walk someone else’s.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s been 30 years, give or take a week or two, since I applied to art school. That was in 1984. It’s funny, thinking back. In ’84, we thought that the British government spying on its own citizens using technology was just going to be dystopian fiction.</p>
<p>What I learned at art school has stayed with me over the 20-something years since I graduated. They were the <strong>lessons that helped me get started in this business</strong>, which wasn’t even on the horizon in 1984. They’re lessons that helped me adapt so that I could stay in business when the business of making websites changed so dramatically.</p>
<p>They’re lessons that enabled me to take risks with my business, risks such as adopting Web standards and responsive design before many of the people around me at the time did.</p>
<p>Art school taught me a lot, but, honestly, going there was a very humbling experience. I came from a small-town school where I’d always been in the top tier for art. I was one of only two people that year who went on to study art, but when I got to university, I felt like everyone around me was much better than me.</p>

<p>I imagine that’s how many people feel when coming to a conference. We’re the “experts” where we work, but at a conference, everyone seems to know more than we do. I feel like that, and I also feel it when I read an article about some new language or about a technique or tool and I think I should learn about it. I doubt I’m the only person who feels this way.</p>
<h3>Finding A Medium That Best Expresses Our Interests And Talents</h3>
<p>Technology is supposed to make our lives less stressful, but it’s hard to think of another industry where what someone does changes so regularly. I’ll admit that I’m more confused than ever about what I need to learn. It’s hard not to feel stressed by the thought that we have to learn or aspire to be an expert in, well, pretty much everything. Sometimes that stress can turn into mild panic when we feel that everyone else knows something we don’t.</p>
<p>When I started designing websites, I used Frontpage, and then Dreamweaver. One of the biggest changes I made to what I do was at the start of the Web standards movement, when I learned to write HTML and CSS. Many designers did the same, but some people think that’s not enough anymore. <a href="http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2014/jan/03/web-standards-killed-the-html-star/">Jeff Croft wrote</a> in January:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2014/jan/03/web-standards-killed-the-html-star/">
<p>&ldquo;What we may not have realized is that once the browsers don’t suck, being an HTML and CSS &lsquo;guru&rsquo; isn’t really a very marketable skillset.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hardly reassuring.</p>
<p>“Diversify or die,” he says, before pointing out that front-end developers are just as likely to be grilled in a job interview on Backbone.js or AngularJS or Node.js as they are on HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>But does every front-end developer need to learn Backbone or Angular or Node? What about designers like me? I learned to write HTML and CSS because I needed them to express the designs that I made. Code became my medium when designing became more than about making an artist’s impression of a website. HTML and CSS were the first “code” I’d ever worked with.</p>
<p>Some of my more technically inclined friends came to use those same languages after they learned programming. Although we both know HTML and CSS, their working knowledge is very different than mine. They know programming languages. They understand JavaScript. They’re comfortable with the command line. They’re the technically minded people who understand Backbone or Angular or Node.</p>
<p>Me, <strong>I couldn’t write a script if my life depended on it</strong>. That’s because my mind works in a different way and I have different working knowledge. This comes from my art and design background, so I might not know Backbone, but I’m a devil with a Bezier curve.</p>
<p>Assuming that someone has the same knowledge as you &mdash; because they share common languages like HTML and CSS &mdash; can leave them baffled. I see these assumptions being made in articles and tutorials time and time again.</p>
<p>I know I don’t have a mind for development, so I never feel under any pressure to learn new development tools or technologies unless they’re directly relevant to the work I’m doing. There’s a very strong likelihood that if you’re a designer, you probably won’t ever need to know how to write a Grunt runner.</p>
<p>Designers might have felt pressure to learn about tools and technologies that have traditionally been the province of those of us who are more technically minded. At the same time, we might still feel pressure to learn about subjects whose roots are in other academic areas &mdash; subjects such as information architecture, content strategy, research and maybe even analysis of data. But do we need to be experts in these areas to be good designers?</p>
<p>It’s easy to feel disheartened when you think that simply “designing” isn’t enough, or that making something beautiful is somehow a superficial endeavour. If you feel like that sometimes, I’m with you, but we should always remember that <strong>making something beautiful takes knowledge and experience</strong>. Understanding proportions and ratios for layout, knowing color principles and “seeing” typography, really seeing it, aren’t things you can learn overnight.</p>
<p>Far from being superficial, “making a website pretty” is a skill that we should be very proud of. It’s also one that’s going to be in demand long after the latest fashionable development framework has been forgotten.</p>
<p>I’m not saying we shouldn’t learn new things or that we should stay in our comfort zone. What matters is finding the right medium to express our ideas and talents. We’ll likely not need to learn everything, but we will need to learn to be great at the things we do.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Zeldman <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2014/01/06/its-2014-is-web-design-dead/">wrote recently</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.zeldman.com/2014/01/06/its-2014-is-web-design-dead/">
<p>&ldquo;[…] now may be the time to up your game as a graphic designer, or experience designer, or front end developer. &lsquo;Diversify or die&rsquo; may be overstating things a bit. But &lsquo;follow the path you love&rsquo; will always be good advice.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you “<a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/its-2014.-web-design-isnt-dead">follow the path you love</a>,” then you’ll find your medium, although it might not be what you expected it to be.</p>
<p>When I went to art school, I thought I was a good painter. That’s because in high school, painting was as much about precision and predictability as it was about creativity. High-school art classes were about learning techniques so that we could reproduce a painting of something that we’d likely painted several times before under exam conditions.</p>
<p>Many people speak today about designing with data, so that we can produce designs that are predictable. <strong>A lot of people crave predictability</strong>, which sometimes makes them rely on data, rather than their own intuition. Personally, though, I want to see designs that are more inspirational than predictable.</p>
<p>The current trend for “flat” design makes me feel very nostalgic. I painted flat because I loved the hard-edged graphic quality of pop art. I also loved David Hockney’s work, especially his “splash” paintings, but I’d only ever seen them reproduced in books, where they were obviously much smaller. The printing process also flattened them, removing the subtlety and depth, something I didn’t realize until I saw the paintings in galleries.</p>
<p>I discovered upon reaching art school that I was actually a pretty poorer painter than my new peers. Unlike them, everything I painted ended up looking flat, no matter what my subject matter was. It wasn’t just the content I’d chosen &mdash; my technique and the way I painted said as much about me as about what I was painting.</p>
<p>We hear a lot today about the benefits of iterating a design; it’s an approach that I recommend to our clients. But, for me, painting wasn’t an iterative process. I couldn’t let a painting develop over time, making my way across the canvas, gradually adding layers of paint. I couldn’t trust in the low fidelity that we see in our gray-box wireframes today. I had neither the faith nor the patience to iterate. I needed to work in high fidelity right from the start. Today, the equivalent would be skipping sketching and diving right into Photoshop to create a high-fidelity design.</p>
<p>Instead, I worked on one part of a painting until it looked finished. Then, I’d move on to the next part. It was like painting by numbers. I kept my eyes so close to the canvas that I couldn’t see what my painting looked like from a distance. <strong>I missed seeing the whole because I was focused on the parts</strong>. As a result, my paintings appeared not only flat, but disjointed. I’m seeing this in today’s website designs, too.</p>
<p>It took me months of dissatisfaction to realize that painting is as much about temperament as about technique. I realized that I wasn’t suited to painting and that it wasn’t the right medium for me to communicate my ideas. I was fortunate because the degree I was studying was “unstructured,” so after the first few weeks of introduction and becoming acclimatized to our new surroundings, we were left as unsupervised as we wanted to be. There was no timetable, no lectures, no set work &mdash; except for a dissertation that I wrote about Batman &mdash; no organized trips to the botanical garden to draw exotic plants. We arrived and our tutors said, “Hello.” Three years later, they came back and said, “So, what did you do?”</p>
<p>The lack of structure allowed students to move between disciplines &mdash; painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography &mdash; whenever we wanted to. This lack of supervision didn’t suit some people. If someone wasn’t highly motivated or didn’t know their path or their medium, then they usually floundered. Some people couldn’t cope at all and so switched to a course that offered more direction. Others left altogether. A few moved into the life-drawing class and never left. They spent three years drawing flabby flesh because they craved the predictability, the reliability that life in the life room gave them. They became incredibly technically proficient &mdash; as you might expect &mdash; but proficiency doesn’t guarantee good art, nor great design.</p>
<h3>Not Getting Drunk On Our Processes Or Falling In Love With Our Tools</h3>
<p>In high school, we’re taught that there’s only one right answer to any question. Our entire education system &mdash; some might say our entire political system &mdash; hangs on the premise that an answer is either right or wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li>Something either is or isn’t.</li>
<li>Something either happened or didn’t.</li>
<li>Something’s either possible or isn’t.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need everything to be right, so we try to find the one right way to do it. It’s <strong>one of the reasons why we come to conferences</strong>. We want to know the right, best way to work with responsive images. We want to know whether Flexbox is what we should be using. We want to discover the best process for designing or developing a website in this modern, responsive era. We want to create systems that make the outcome of design predictable. But:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if there is no right way to work with responsive images?</li>
<li>What if Flexbox is useful, sometimes?</li>
<li>What if there is no best process for responsive design?</li>
<li>What if systems hinder the creative process?</li>
</ul>
<p>Samantha Warren wrote about <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/style-tiles-and-how-they-work">style tiles on A List Apart</a> back in 2012:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://alistapart.com/article/style-tiles-and-how-they-work">
<p>&ldquo;Style tiles are the cornerstone of a solid design system that sets client expectations and communicates the visual theme to all the project team members. Designing a system rather than site pages gives your team the tools to create a living, breathing website.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve been writing about how to avoid setting the wrong expectations for a few years. In particular, <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/time_to_stop_showing_clients_static_design_visuals">I’ve written</a> about how the processes, tools and artefacts that we’ve inappropriately brought with us from historical media to the Web can hinder communication and reinforce the wrong expectations.</p>
<p>Since the earliest days of the Web, designers have been using graphics tools &mdash; such as Photoshop, then Fireworks and lately Sketch &mdash; to create full-page visuals that are intended to <strong>demonstrate how a website will look when it reaches a browser</strong>. Designers will often create visuals of dozens of templates or pages. These comps (or PSDs or flat static visuals or high-fidelity design artefacts) not only are used for experimentation and creative expression, but actually become the currency of Web design. Designers exchange them with clients for approval and then for money. Clients and designers exchange them with developers to be used as blueprints for the content, design and functionality of a website, then, finally, as QA tools. But despite their popularity and longevity, they’re terribly ill-suited to all of those roles.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/time_to_stop_showing_clients_static_design_visuals"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/static-visuals.jpg" alt="Static Visuals" title="Static Visuals" width="500" height="192" /></a><br /><em>The tools and processes we’ve relied on for years are no longer capable of properly designing today’s flexible, responsive Web.</em></p>
<p>Using these static visuals is “<a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/bringing_a_knife_to_a_gunfight_my_slide_deck_from_an_event_apart_austin_201">bringing a knife to a gun fight</a>.” They can only communicate something that’s superficial, artificial. They’re high-fructose, extra sweet, but even though of little nutritional value, people love them and so want more and more. We designers have largely learned to live with all of the deficiencies of static visuals, and we compensate for them with our familiarity with the tools that we use to make them.</p>
<p>Worse than any deficiency is the frequent absence of communication when we hand a visual to someone and ask them to judge it. Instead of using visuals as aids to communication, we let the visuals speak for us. This happens especially when we email them or upload them to Basecamp, along with some vague request for “thoughts.”</p>
<p>When we hide behind design artefacts in this way, we leave a tremendous amount open to misinterpretation and, because of that, are far more likely to set the wrong expectations. Type rendering <em>will</em> look different on a real device. Fonts <em>won’t</em> be exactly that size on all devices. The layout <em>will</em> be different at various viewport widths.</p>
<p>So, what are our goals when showing a static visual to someone, usually a client? Once we’re past the feedback stages, we’re likely looking for sign-off on a design. We need that approval either to conclude our business or to confirm that a design is ready to move to another phase. Of course, we’re not really asking them to judge the visual at all, are we? In reality, we’re asking them to look beyond the visual and to judge what they extrapolate will be the look of the finished Web page. In effect, what we’re saying is, “Here is a better than artist’s impression.”</p>
<p>For their judgement to be at all meaningful, we therefore need to make the visual to be of the highest fidelity. Ideally, we’d like it to look identical to a screenshot of the finished page. When we’re asking for sign-off, we’re implying that the finished Web page will ultimately be a facsimile of this visual, a carbon copy, a clone. And if that’s not what we’re saying, then what’s the point of asking someone to approve it at all?</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered &mdash; responsive websites aside &mdash; why so many Web pages are fixed width and centered in the viewport? Do you think it has anything to do with the fact that clients sign off on fixed-width visuals. I’d say one’s a direct result of the other. I’d go further and suggest that asking for approval on visuals should be considered harmful, because we’re reinforcing that outdated notion that a Web page should be a facsimile of a frozen image.</p>
<p>We’ve been suffering from the effects of this notion for years, because when we ask for sign-off on a frozen image, we immediately leave ourselves open to the problems that often come when we later have to implement that design. Think back to the number of times you were <strong>forced to explain to a client why Internet Explorer doesn’t render</strong> your border-radii, box-shadows, CSS columns or gradients. Think about how many hours you then wasted employing polyfills to prop up an aging browser, just so that it could live up to the promise you made when you sold the visual to the client. To save ourselves from this agony over the years, we’ve designed to the lowest common denominator in our matrix of browser support. We’ve eschewed so many useful CSS properties until the dominance of those legacy browsers faded. My book <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/buy/hardboiledwebdesign"><em>Hardboiled Web Design</em></a> was all about how to challenge that unambitious thinking.</p>
<p>One of the things I admire about Samantha Warren’s approach is that she emphasizes communication. Samantha says that style tiles “provide a catalyst for discussions,” and I really appreciate that because what often matters most isn’t the way we design but the ways we communicate it.</p>
<p>I spoke earlier about finding the right medium, and it became very clear to me that high-fidelity visuals, those that represent the future look of complete pages, are rarely the right medium to communicate Web design. When a visual encapsulates everything about a design, instead of helping us to find clarity, it provokes multiple conversations about different topics, all at the same time. We might need to talk about typography. Instead, the client’s eye wanders across the page because they’re distracted by the size of the logo. Other times, we might want to talk about color as part of an interaction vocabulary, but they can’t help noticing an out-of-date product photo. People too easily get distracted and conversations become unfocused when we show the totality of a design too soon.</p>
<p>I’ve been searching for a <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/an-extract-from-designing-atoms-and-elements">better medium to communicate my designs</a>, and I’ve found that separating a design into several components is incredibly helpful. I’ve also found since doing so that my conversations about the design have been more focused and productive.</p>
<p>How often have you heard someone say, “I don’t like the design.” Did you dig deeper and find that it wasn’t the details of the design they objected to, or that it wasn’t the typefaces or the way you used color. No? It might have been, “The sidebar should go on the left, not the right.” People often mean to comment on the layout of a design but express their criticism of the design as a whole. They conflate layout with the look and feel and call it “design.” Designers do it, too, because we’re used to making and demonstrating visuals that include all of these things. But now it’s time to discuss non-layout and layout elements of design separately.</p>
<p>This means that the look and feel of individual components and how they are arranged on a grid are now two separate design challenges and that, whereas layout will undoubtably change across screen sizes, the look and feel of a component will almost certainly stay the same.</p>
<p><img alt="The devices we are designing for today are a variety of sizes" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/responsive-frameworks-opt2.png"><br />
<em>The devices and screens we design for today are a variety of sizes. (Image credit: <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>)</em></p>
<p>Take away layout and what’s left is what I describe as the “atmosphere” of a design. Atmosphere refers to the feelings that are evoked by color, texture and typography. You might already think of atmosphere in different terms. You might call it “feel,” “mood” or even “visual identity.” However you describe it, the atmosphere of a design doesn’t depend on layout. It’s independent of arrangement and visual placement. It will be seen, or felt, at every screen size and on every device.</p>
<p>The idea of working on components out of context has been gathering pace over the last few years. If it sounds strange, in fact we’ve been abstracting design this way for a long time &mdash; for example, when we create mood boards or share cropped Dribbble shots. In his article “<a href="http://trentwalton.com/2011/07/14/content-choreography/">Content Choreography</a>,” Trent Walton writes:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://trentwalton.com/2011/07/14/content-choreography/">
<p>&ldquo;Web designers will have to look beyond the layout in front of them to envision how its elements will reflow &amp; lockup at various widths while maintaining form &amp; hierarchy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I like this approach, because separating components from layout can help everyone to focus on the design, while setting no expectations of how the components will be arranged responsively across viewport sizes.</p>
<p>I said earlier that we love to identify patterns and create systems because we crave predictability. That’s why we’re always searching for the “right” process. But while separating components from the layout and designing them independently has improved communication, I know that this approach doesn’t work for everyone and is certainly not right for every project. That’s why I’m wary of defining it as a “process.”</p>
<p>I’m wary because I’ve learned how important it is not to let our processes define what we make. When I read about design process, I’m worried that we’re simply replacing one set of design artefacts with another &mdash; in this case, Photoshop visuals for pattern libraries &mdash; and that we’re becoming so intoxicated by our processes and falling so deeply in love with our new tools that we’ll again lose sight of what we’re actually making.</p>
<h3>Challenging What We’re Told</h3>
<p>Back in 2009, I gave a talk titled “<a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/walls_come_tumbling_down_presentation_slides_and_transcript/">Walls Come Tumbling Down</a>,” in which I discussed how important it is to make more time, time to be creative. I suggested then that we should reduce repetition &mdash; make fewer high-fidelity visuals &mdash; and design systems instead of pages. I should be clear that I was talking about designing a system, not design <em>as</em> a system.</p>
<p>Design-system thinking has taken hold, and it can take several forms, from style guides as a design deliverable to full-blown pattern libraries as design tools, not documentation. There are now some widely cited pattern libraries, including one by Starbucks and <a href="http://patterns.alistapart.com/">one for A List Apart</a>.</p>
<p>One system that’s become synonymous with responsive Web design is Brad Frost’s “<a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">atomic design</a>.” Brad wrote about atomic design just last summer:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">
<p>&ldquo;Lately I’ve been more interested in what our interfaces are comprised of and how we can construct design systems in a more methodical way.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to describe how his system comprises atoms, molecules, organisms, templates and pages, the result of which should be:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">
<p>&ldquo;a clear methodology for crafting design systems.[…] Because of this, we can create systems that promote consistency and scalability. And by assembling rather than deconstructing, we’re crafting a system right out of the gate instead of cherry picking patterns after the fact.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brad’s inspiration for atomic design was chemistry’s periodic table. I can’t imagine anything <em>less</em> creatively stimulating.</p>
<p>Not everyone’s convinced about abstracting design the atomic design way, though. <a href="http://markboulton.co.uk/journal/design-abstraction-escalation">Mark Boulton wrote of his concerns</a> last year:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://markboulton.co.uk/journal/design-abstraction-escalation">
<p>&ldquo;Conformity and efficiency have a price. And that price is design. That price is a feeling of humanity. Of something that’s been created from scratch. What I described is not a design process. It’s <em>manufacturing</em>. It’s a cupcake machine churning out identical cakes with different icing. But they all taste the same.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s important to remember that creativity should never be &mdash; by definition, <em>can</em> never be &mdash; as predictable as a manufacturing process. We cannot and should not attempt to rationalize creativity by moulding it into a process.</p>
<p>Fletcher Knebel, an American writer born in 1911, said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is now proved beyond doubt that that smoking is one of the leading causes of statistics.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of finding more time for research and data gathering, I’d like to use any extra time we have to come up with new, better ideas, because no amount of research is a substitute for a good idea. At least not on its own.</p>
<p>Peter Seibel, one of the designers at Etsy, <a href="http://codeascraft.com/2012/06/21/building-websites-with-science/">said this</a> in 2012:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://codeascraft.com/2012/06/21/building-websites-with-science/">
<p>&ldquo;Science is powerful and it’d be silly to abandon it entirely just because there are ways it can go wrong. And it’d be equally silly to think that science can somehow replace strong, talented product designers. The goal should be to combine the two.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most important lessons I learned at art school were not to take what we hear or see at face value and to question everything we’re told. Everyone should do that. I want you to always ask, “Can I do it better?” Remember that <strong>just because something’s been done doesn’t mean you can’t do it better</strong>. There’s really nothing we can’t improve, and we don’t have to improve it for everyone &mdash; improving it for ourselves is often more important.</p>
<p>We’re very fortunate in our industry to have the ability and the tools to improve something that someone’s made &mdash; be it a small piece of code or a full framework, a tip or a complete workflow. Blogs, RSS and, more recently, Twitter enable us to hear of a new method minutes after it’s been written up. Tools like CodePen and GitHub allow us to fork code and make it our own.</p>
<p>I published my open-source <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/projects/contract-killer/">Contract Killer</a> on GitHub, and the best part of doing that wasn’t giving people a chance to use what I made, but giving them an opportunity to add their own insights to make it better. In fact, nothing I’ve shared hasn’t been improved simply from being shared.</p>
<p>But sharing is just a catalyst; <strong>developing an idea takes time and patience</strong>. I mentioned earlier that at art school I couldn’t let a painting develop over time. I needed to start in high fidelity. My friend Ben, on the other hand, and other painters around me knew how to let a painting develop. Ben started the course by making six giant 6 &#215; 6-foot stretchers. He then spent all three years working on those six paintings.</p>
<p>I saw Ben more often in the pub than in the studio. He’d come to the studio once a week, sometimes twice. Each time he’d add a subtle layer to each painting. Some weeks, he’d wrap a rag in white spirit and take paint off those canvases. I find that fascinating, that we can make something better by taking part of it away, by reducing, simplifying, rather than adding to it.</p>
<p>It took a long time for Ben’s paintings to develop, not just in fidelity but also in the purity of his ideas. I wonder now whether he had a clear idea of how they’d develop or what they’d develop into when he started? I hope he didn’t. I hope that he allowed his ideas to develop as he painted them. It’s a shame I never asked him. Whatever he thought by the end of the course, Ben had six beautifully subtle, exquisitely layered paintings that I could only dream of making.</p>
<p>Asking “Can I do it better?” and challenging an idea or implementation isn’t disrespectful to the idea or to the person who shared it. Seeing an idea of yours being referred to, being improved upon, begin a life of its own is a wonderful feeling. Challenging well is respectful to the idea and to the person who thought of it. Challenging isn’t always easy, particularly if we don’t think of ourselves as equal with the other person. Comparing ourself to others can feel uncomfortable. Always remember, though, that we each contribute from our own perspective, and that perspective is as equally valuable as any other.</p>

<p>I work in my own small studio with one other designer. Our ideas on process and workflow are likely very different from those of similar teams working in similar small studios, and different again from those of us who work in large companies and organizations. A different perspective can take an idea in a direction that its originator couldn’t have imagined. An idea can be made immeasurably better simply by being looked at from a different point of view.</p>
<p>Challenging what we’re told, questioning received wisdom will have its consequences, particularly when other people have a vested interest in what we’re challenging. Those consequences might be greater if you work in a large company or organization than in a small company, as I do. I’ve built a business in which challenging convention and pursuing new ideas without many consequences is possible. That’s why my advice to <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/universal_internet_explorer_6_css/">serve a single “universal” style sheet to legacy versions</a> of Internet Explorer across all websites wasn’t just an idea. I’d already tried it on my own clients for months, and not a single person had complained.</p>
<p>Both of <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/books">my books</a> are about seizing the potential of new techniques and technologies, whether it’s designing in a browser or pushing ahead with cutting-edge, experimental CSS properties. While those ideas are mainstream now, when I wrote them the response was far from complimentary. I think that response came from a reticence to change. It possibly also came from fear, and too often we limit an idea’s potential because we worry about the consequences of failure too early. How many times have you seen a great idea dashed at your place of work when someone said, “We can’t do this because…”</p>
<p>Children challenge ideas all the time. They have a talent for asking questions, for asking “Why?” All. The. Time. (If you have kids, you’ll know that.) They haven’t learned to fear consequences in the same way that adults do because they haven’t been conditioned to think of those consequences.</p>
<p>Rather than dimming the flickering flame of an idea, questioning it helps it to grow. We should ask more questions. We should make asking questions a habit.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Who says we can’t?”</li>
<li>“Why can’t we do that?”</li>
<li>“Why do we have so many meetings?”</li>
<li>“Why do designers and developers work on different teams?”</li>
<li>“Why do designers and developers work in separate buildings?”</li>
<li>“Why can’t we start writing code until a design has been signed off?”</li>
<li>“Why can’t I talk to the client?”</li>
<li>“Why can’t we serve just a typography style sheet to legacy browsers?”</li>
<li>“Why is this list of questions so long?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Asking these types of question can stimulate ideas. Always remember that whatever environment you work in, along with any consequences come opportunities, opportunities to create something special.</p>
<h3>Beating Our Own Paths, Not Walking Someone Else’s</h3>
<p>For 15 years, I worked mainly on my own, and when I look back now, I realize just how much I struggled without having much of the stimulation you get from working with other people. Honestly, I don’t think I could have succeeded were it not for the self-motivation that I learned all those years ago at art school.</p>
<p>Just over a year ago, we hired another designer, and we now work together in my tiny studio three days every week. The transformation has been remarkable. I feel like we have more ideas, better ideas, and we’re now doing our best work together. I feel we’re only just getting started.</p>
<p>People can feel isolated, starved of inspiration, even when working alongside others, if the organization’s structure and environment make it hard to keep ideas flowing. Many organizations classify its people in just the same way that we classify elements when writing HTML:</p>
<ul>
<li>graphic designer</li>
<li>user-interface designer</li>
<li>user-experience designer</li>
<li>digital product designer</li>
<li>Web developer</li>
<li>front-end developer</li>
<li>front-end architect</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, what’s written on your business card doesn’t necessarily restrict you from coming up with ideas, but <strong>classifications can have consequences on creativity</strong>. When you define a role for yourself or are assigned one, at best that role can limit what you do, and at worst it can limit what you aspire to do. Roles and responsibilities can define boundaries. I’ve seen the protection of those boundaries turn into battles over territory.</p>
<p>If you’re a “Web designer,” how would the “UX professionals” you work with feel if you made wireframes? I’ve worked with user-experience designers who are very touchy about designers encroaching on their territory. By the same token, how do we designers react when front-end developers make decisions that affect layout when implementing a design? Do we react negatively? Have you heard a designer say, “But that’s my job.”</p>
<p>When we cross into someone else’s area of expertise, work with their tools, use that new knowledge, take their perspective, we can be inspired to move in a different direction. Stepping into someone else’s shoes not only gives us an appreciation of their work, but inspires us to make our own work better.</p>
<p>Also, grouping people into, for example, a team of user-experience designers, a team of graphic designers and another team of developers can have a tremendous impact not only on the flexibility of a project but on how ideas flow between those teams.</p>
<p>The most successful projects I’ve worked on in recent years have been the ones in which the client, rather than assigning us to specialist teams, created a “project team.” This team would include people from all disciplines &mdash; designers, developers, content specialists. We worked alongside each other in a single space and had an open-door policy to encourage everyone in the organization to look at what we were making. This fed us new ideas and, coincidentally, allowed for impromptu user testing and device testing when they brought their phones with them. The best projects for me are always the ones that are filled with questions, because they prompt us to be creative with our answers.</p>
<p>The late <a href="https://aaronsw.jottit.com/howtoget">Aaron Swartz wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://aaronsw.jottit.com/howtoget">
<p>&ldquo;Be curious. Read widely. Try new things. I think that a lot of what people call intelligence just boils down to curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We often lose this trait of curiosity as adults. As well as asking “Why?” we should also perpetually ask “What if?”</p>
<p>This year is the 10th anniversary of <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog">my blog</a> and also the 10th anniversary of many groundbreaking articles published on <a href="http://alistapart.com">A List Apart</a>. These articles have made it possible for us to make the websites that we make today. Many of the authors of those articles simply asked “What if?”</p>
<p>Take <a href="http://twitter.com/stop">Douglas Bowman</a>, now creative director at Twitter. By 2002, Mark Newhouse had already written about how to <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/taminglists/">turn unordered lists into navigation</a>. We take that for granted today. But those lists still looked boxy then, and people sincerely complained that CSS designs looked “boring.” So Doug asked, “What if I use two background images to make tabs?” and in 2003 he devised “<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/slidingdoors">Sliding Doors of CSS</a>.”</p>
<p>Or take <a href="http://twitter.com/simplebits">Dan Cederholm</a>, cofounder of <a href="http://dribbble.com">Dribbble</a>. Ten years ago, no one had solved the problem of how to make the backgrounds of two unequal columns the same height using CSS. A List Apart published Dan’s “<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/fauxcolumns">Faux Columns</a>,” in which he asked, “What if I cheat and use a repeating background image on the parent container?”</p>
<p>Also in January 2004, Patrick Griffiths asked, “What if I use ems instead of pixels or percentages for layout?” He invented the concept of “<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/elastic/">elastic design</a>.” <a href="http://twitter.com/mezzoblue">Dave Shea</a>, curator of the recently relaunched <a href="http://csszengarden.com">CSS Zen Garden</a> asked in 2004, again in A List Apart, “What if I put all of my icons into one image?” thus inventing <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/sprites">CSS sprites</a>, a technique that’s stood up so well that we use it today.</p>
<p>Those questions, those “What ifs?” sparked ideas that went on to change the way we designed and developed websites for the next 10 years. Being curious works just as well today as it did then for those people who made it possible for us to build websites with HTML and CSS.</p>
<ul>
<li>“What if we use a different design artefact to communicate?”</li>
<li>“What if we work in a browser instead of Photoshop?”</li>
<li>“What if we designed mobile first?”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Summing Up</h3>
<p>Being at art school taught me a lot of things. In fact, I learned more about work and about business and about myself than I did about art. I’ve remembered the lessons that I learned and have tried to apply them in everything I’ve done in the 30 years since then. For over half of that time, I’ve worked for myself, making websites for other people, so the lessons that I learned about staying self-motivated have been invaluable.</p>
<p>Art school taught me the most important lesson in my working life, which is to be adaptable. I’m in a place now that I could not have imagined back then, and <strong>in 10 years you’ll be in a place that you can’t imagine now</strong>. Finding a medium to express your interests and your talents is vital. When you work by yourself &mdash; as I did for a long time &mdash; or you feel like you’re on your own, learning where to find inspiration will serve you well, too.</p>
<p>I’ve learned since then that becoming intoxicated by a process and forgetting what really matters &mdash; the idea &mdash; is too easy. Falling deeply in love with our tools is easy, whether it be a printmaking tool or today’s favorite application or fashionable framework. Used thoughtlessly, any tool or process can become a distraction. I don’t want to forget that lesson.</p>
<p>I also won’t forget the people who have made it possible for me to share what I know. I can’t imagine that people share what they’ve discovered so freely with total strangers in any other industry. That’s what I hope you do: take what you learn here and make something better. Most importantly of all, share what you make so that other people can learn from it. Be generous with your ideas.</p>
<p>Seth Godin said recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The generosity of standing up and speaking comes through. We have to acknowledge to ourselves that this decision to be generous and to stand for the work we do without blaming someone else for it is the element of brand that matters the most as we go forward.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is a modern designer’s canvas? It’s not Photoshop or Sketch. It’s not pattern libraries or style guides. It’s not breakpoints or media queries. It’s none of these things. It’s up here. It’s our minds, our ideas. But it’s also out there, in the people we inspire. And that really is the best, most important and longest-lasting work we can do.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://fireworks.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/26/mojo-motors-responsive-redesign-with-adobe-fireworks-part-1/">previous article</a> in this series, I discussed our ideation and initial prototyping process. We covered details on how to use Adobe Fireworks to set up a responsive design wireframe, reusable components, prototypes and ways to share designs.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll share how we used Adobe Fireworks in our iterative visual design process, along with other useful tips.</p>
<h3>Why Adobe Fireworks?</h3>
<p>Before diving into details, let’s acknowledge that Fireworks became feature-frozen in May 2013 and that some of the visual results discussed in this article could have been achieved using alternative graphics software, such as Photoshop, Illustrator or <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a>. But the hard truth is that Fireworks is still used by many designers and offers a unique workflow and integrated feature set, unmatched by any program available. For a good read on why Fireworks is still relevant, I recommend “<a href="http://fireworks.smashingmagazine.com/2013/12/19/present-future-adobe-fireworks/" title="an article by Michel Bozgounov (Smashing Magazine)">The Present and Future of Adobe Fireworks</a>.”</p>
<h4>In Search of the Key Design Tool</h4>
<p>As discussed in the “Creating Wireframes And Prototypes” section of part 1, our choice of a design tool came down to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed</strong><br />Fireworks proved to be quicker for directly creating and manipulating visual elements on the screen than other tools, like Photoshop and Illustrator. The combination of integrated vector tools and bitmap-editing capabilities in one package, plus pages, states, symbols, styles and extensions, was something unique and worked best for us.</li>
<li><strong>File size</strong><br />We found that PSD visual design files created in Photoshop for the same screen designs are much larger than those created in Fireworks &mdash; sometimes <strong>two to five times</strong> larger.</li>
<li><strong>Team learning curve</strong><br />When <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/gabejgross">Gabriel Gross</a> (our visual UI designer) joined the team, we had already created a lot of wireframes in Fireworks. He initially considered just translating those wireframes to Photoshop. Because of the amount of work that would have been required, he decided to try Fireworks on a few screens. About a week later, he suggested working directly from the Fireworks PNG wireframe files, instead of recreating the designs from scratch. From this point forward, we’ve been using the wireframe files as the starting point for visual design screens.</li>
<li><strong>Workflow and efficiency</strong><br />Reusing wireframes as a staring point really helped us get from wireframes to high-fidelity visuals in record time. We were able to take advantage of the efficiencies built into sharing files and iterating on them together. For a detailed look at a similar workflow, check out “<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/fireworks/articles/cooper_interactive.html">Designing Interactive Products With Fireworks</a>” by Nick Myers of <a href="http://www.cooper.com/">Cooper</a> and “<a href="http://fireworks.smashingmagazine.com/2013/01/11/ios-prototyping-adobe-fireworks-tap-part1/">iOS Prototyping With Adobe Fireworks and TAP</a>” by <a href="http://fireworks.smashingmagazine.com/author/shlomo-goltz/">Shlomo Goltz</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Gabriel was also familiar with Adobe Flash and its various features and quirks. The transition to Fireworks was fairly straightforward &mdash; the Properties panel that spans the bottom of the screen, navigation of nested symbols, the symbols library and so on are quite similar in Fireworks and Flash.</p>
<h3>Exploring Branding and Style</h3>
<p>As discussed in the previous article, the design team decided on a pragmatic approach to creating visual elements. We decided early on in the project that we would only do as much visual layout and style exploration as necessary in graphics applications &mdash; the rest would be done through an iterative process in the browser. With this in mind, we ditched any elaborate branding exercise needed just for <strong>stakeholder buy-in</strong> and opted to create style tiles and a revised logo.</p>
<h4>So, What Are Style Tiles?</h4>
<p>Style tiles are a design document consisting of fonts, colors and interface elements that communicate the essence of the visual brand of a website or application. They help to communicate a proposed common visual language and can be used to discuss style preferences that meet the goals of the stakeholders or client. <a href="http://samanthatoy.com">Samantha Warren</a> explains the workflow pretty well in her article on A List Apart, “<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/style-tiles-and-how-they-work">Style Tiles and How They Work</a>,” so I won’t go into deeper detail than this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Websites are so much more than just usable interfaces: they tell a story&#8230;</p>
<p>Style tiles are a flexible starting point that define a style to communicate the web in a way that clients understand. A style tile is more refined than a traditional identity mood board and less detailed than a website mockup or comp. When an interior designer redesigns a room they don’t build multiple options of the designs they’re proposing, they bring color swatches, paint chips, and architectural drawings. Style tiles act as paint chips and color swatches for the interface that we can execute on any device or at any dimension. It’s a truly responsive solution to visual design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To learn more about style tiles, I recommend also visiting Samantha’s website <a href="http://www.styletil.es">Style Tiles</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mojo_Style_Tile_lg-opt.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mojo_Style_Tile_sm1-opt.png" alt="Mojo Style Tile" width="500" height="373" /></a><br /><em>An sample style tile from Mojo Motors’ redesign process. (<a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mojo_Style_Tile_lg-opt.jpg">View large version</a>)</em></p>
<h4>Typography and Typecast</h4>
<p>Most designers would agree that their favorite graphics application does not provide an accurate preview of how text will appear in the browser. With this in mind, we did as much text layout as was needed in graphics applications and then explored the finer typographical details in the browser. There, we could also accurately evaluate the effect of responsive layouts on the type as we moved through breakpoints.</p>
<p>In working with fonts, we faced the same <a href="http://typecast.com/about">dilemma explained by the Typecast team</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We discovered that working with system fonts in Fireworks was faster for our designers, but build was slow because our developers had to interpret fonts and classes, resolve inconsistencies and negotiate font compromises with the designers. Plus there was that pesky problem of comp fonts not always resembling site fonts due to the rendering.</p>
<p>And when we moved to designing with web fonts, it was the opposite problem. It was faster for developers because there were fewer negotiations and less guesswork. But designers were wasting valuable project time stepping through a really repetitious process to get the web fonts into their layouts. You know the deal:</p>
<p><em>Go to URL &rarr; Paste copy &rarr; Preview &rarr; Capture &rarr; Import to comp &rarr; Resize &rarr; Arrange – Repeat<sup>40</sup> &rarr; Find typos &rarr; Pull hair out &rarr; Repeat &rarr; Show client comp &rarr; Get requests to make bigger, smaller, different &rarr; Die a little inside &rarr; Repeat<sup>20</sup></em></p>
<p>Both approaches had serious drawbacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, to help us compare and narrow down Web fonts for Mojo Motors’ website, we turned to Typecast’s own solution.</p>

<p><a href="http://typecast.com">Typecast</a> is a powerful browser-based design tool that makes it easy to experiment and design with the actual Web fonts that you plan to use on your website. The application lets you design visually and builds standards-compliant HTML and CSS in the background. Each Typecast subscription also comes with access to Web fonts from Typekit, Font Deck and Google, as well as a free Fonts.com account. Other features include the ability to create style guides and to share projects. Typecast is really a game-changer, and I highly recommend considering it as part of your responsive design toolkit.</p>
<h4>Redesigning Mojo Motors’ Logo</h4>
<p>As part of the website redesign, our team was also tasked with rethinking the company’s logo. All of the logo explorations were done in Illustrator, which is better suited to this type of work. Using Illustrator made more sense because it enabled us to create and output both CMYK files for print and RGB files for the screen.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mojoLogo_B-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mojoLogo_B-opt.png" alt="Mojo Logo" width="500" height="232" /></a><br /><em>The logo redesign combined elements of the old wordmark, a symbol and a new typeface.</em></p>

<h3>Setting Up The Workspace For Visual Design</h3>
<p>The key to using an existing Fireworks wireframe file for visual design work is to set up the application and the files properly. As discussed in the previous article, we did this up front so that we could take advantage of the application’s pixel-precise layout capabilities and increase our overall efficiency throughout the project.</p>
<p>Let’s quickly cover the basics.</p>
<h4>Keyboard Shortcuts</h4>
<p>One thing that can speed up the completion of tasks in Fireworks is mastering the keyboard shortcuts. For someone transitioning from another Adobe application, Fireworks provides the option to customize the keyboard shortcuts to closely match those of Photoshop, Illustrator or InDesign &mdash; or any variation you may need, for that matter. Our team settled on Photoshop’s shortcuts because they were the most familiar.</p>
<p>Changing these settings in Fireworks is easy. In Windows go to <code>Edit &#8594; Keyboard Shortcuts</code>, or on a Mac go to <code>Edit &#8594; Fireworks &#8594; Keyboard Shortcuts</code>. Then, select “Photoshop” or another shortcut set from the “Current Set” dropdown menu, and click “OK.”</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/keyboard_shortcuts_AA-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/keyboard_shortcuts_AA-opt.png" alt="Keyboard shortcut window" width="500" height="619" /></a><br /><em>Customizing shortcuts in Fireworks.</em></p>
<p>To customize further, open the “Keyboard Shortcuts” dialog again:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the “Commands” field, select a specific Fireworks menu command or tool.</li>
<li>Type a new shortcut combo in the “Press Key” field, and click the “Change” button;</li>
<li>When you are done editing the shortcuts, save the shortcut set as a variant of the set you selected previously (e.g. “My_Custom_Set”).</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you can work faster using the keyboard shortcuts that you are familiar with!</p>
<h4>Grids, Guides, Rulers and Tooltips</h4>
<p>The great thing about carefully setting our responsive design grids during the process of creating a wireframe is that all of the grids and guides that we needed were already in place for the visual design process. Below are some of the options that we enabled when setting up our initial files.</p>
<p><strong>Rulers</strong> are really handy for orienting yourself visually and are required for working with guides on the screen (in the menu, <code>View &rarr; Rulers</code>).</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fw-rulers-mac_lg-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/fw-rulers-mac_sm-opt.png" alt="Rulers in Fireworks" width="500" height="368" /></a><br /><em>Rulers around the canvas.</em></p>
<p>We set our visible horizontal and vertical <strong>background grids</strong> to 10 pixels. Grids and of some their options can be accessed by going to <code>View &rarr; Grid &rarr; Show Grid/Snap to Grid/Edit Grid…</code> or by going to <code>Edit &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Guides and Grids</code>.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bkg_grid_window_B_lg-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bkg_grid_window-opt.png" alt="Guides and Grids Settings window" width="500" height="383" /></a><br /><em>The guides and grids settings in “Preferences”.</em></p>
<p>This setting works well also because it matches the pixel increment (10 pixels) when objects are moved on the screen (for example, when we nudge an element using the <code>Shift + arrow</code> key shortcut). We often toggle this setting on and off as needed when drawing.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bkg_grids-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bkg_grids-opt.png" alt="Background grid shown on canvas over artwork" width="500" height="364" /></a><br /><em>A vertical and horizontal background grid of 10-pixel increments.</em></p>
<p>We typically add <strong>guides</strong> to match the responsive grid layers and other objects as needed; guides are then toggled on and off while drawing. Guides in Fireworks are page-specific and don’t automatically appear on all pages unless placed on a master layer.</p>
<p>Here are a few useful tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Position unlocked guides precisely in Fireworks by clicking on a guide and entering the position directly.</li>
<li>Check guide’s spacing by placing your cursor between two guides and holding down the <code>Shift</code> key.</li>
<li>If you move a guide while holding down the <code>Shift</code> key, you can also precisely dial in the spacing.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/guidemove_precision-opt.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/guidemove_precision-opt.jpg" alt="Moving guide with precision" width="500" height="214" /></a><br /><em>Position guides accurately by double-clicking a guide.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Guides_measure_small-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Guides_measure_small-opt.png" alt="Guides Spacing Measurement" width="500" height="156" /></a><br /><em>Measure guide spacing by pressing <code>Shift</code> between guides.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Guides_move_sm_cropped-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Guides_move_sm_cropped-opt.png" alt="Guides visual positioning" width="500" height="161" /></a><br /><em>Reposition guides visually by holding down <code>Shift</code> while moving a guide.</em></p>
<p>Guides and their options can be accessed via <code>View &rarr; Guides &rarr; Show Guides/Lock Guides/Snap to Guides/Clear Guides…</code>. You can also use keyboard shortcuts to speed up these operations.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To do more with guides, I highly recommend the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/fireworks/articles/guides_panel.html">Guides</a> panel extension by Eugene Jude, which enables you to create guides from selections, copy and paste guides, etc.</p>
<p>For an in-depth look at grid and guide workflows, check the “<a href="http://fireworks.smashingmagazine.com/2012/08/28/fireworks-extensions-for-better-workflow/#grids">Grids Panel</a>” and the “<a href="http://fireworks.smashingmagazine.com/2012/08/28/fireworks-extensions-for-better-workflow/#guides">Guides Panel</a>” sections in Ashish Bogawat’s article “<a href="http://fireworks.smashingmagazine.com/2012/08/28/fireworks-extensions-for-better-workflow/">Optimizing the Design Workflow With Fireworks Extensions</a>.” (By the way, a similar panel named <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/01/03/guideguide-free-plugin-for-dealing-with-grids-in-photoshop/">GuideGuide</a> has recently become available for Photoshop users as well.)</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Guides_panel_blur-opt.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Guides_panel_blur-opt.jpg" alt="Guides panel showing selection tab" width="500" height="384" /></a><br /><em>Guides panel extension.</em></p>
<p><strong>Smart guides</strong> are really helpful and enable you to visually align objects on the screen without having to use the Align panel. Turning these on (by going to <code>View &rarr; Smart Guides</code>) will allow you to see the precise adjustments to the location or size of an object when performing a free transform operation.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/smart_guides-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/smart_guides-opt.png" alt="Smart Guide" width="500" height="337" /></a><br /><em>Smart guides for visual alignment.</em></p>
<p><strong>Useful tip:</strong> If you find yourself creating a lot of responsive design grids, then you might also want to consider the <a href="http://johndunning.com/fireworks/about/Grids">Insert Grids</a> extension by <a href="https://twitter.com/fwextensions">John Dunning</a>.</p>
<h4>Color Management, Color Picker and Swatches</h4>
<p>Unlike the rest of Adobe’s Creative Suite, Fireworks does not require any particular color management settings for you to get started. The application was designed from the ground up for screen design, and it is set to the <strong>RGB color space</strong> out of the box.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Color Palette panel, in addition to the RGB, HSV and HLS color spaces, also shows a CMYK option, but it is not recommended for print work.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/color-modes-lg-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/color-modes-sm-opt.png" alt="Smart Guide" width="500" height="329" /></a><br /><em>Options in the Color Palette panel.</em></p>
<p>The popup <strong>color picker</strong> is quite easy to use and is one of the best ways to specify colors for a user interface. It supports RGB and HEX color selection by default, as well as the more flexible RGBa specification that is supported by all modern browsers. Another useful feature is the one-click color copy feature. (As of the time of writing, Sketch is the only other app that has similar RGBa capabilities. Also worth mentioning is that Adobe has just added color-picker options for fills and strokes in Photoshop CS6 and CC.)</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/colorbox_picker-opt.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/colorbox_picker-opt.jpg" alt="Color Box Picker" width="500" height="348" /></a><br /><em>Fireworks’s color picker.</em></p>
<p>To bring in the color palette from our exploration, we saved an RGB <code>.ASE</code> file in Illustrator and imported it into Fireworks with the help of the <strong>Swatches</strong> panel. Once imported, the color scheme became immediately available in the color picker.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ASE_swatch_lg1-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ASE_swatch_sm-opt.jpg" alt="ASE swatch import export" width="500" height="438" /></a><br /><em>Export the .ASE swatch file from illustrator and import it into Fireworks.</em></p>
<p>The <strong>Color Palette</strong> panel is a great alternative to using the Swatches panel or color picker to specify colors. The panel is broken down into “Selector,” “Mixer” and “Blender” tabs.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/color_palette_B_lg-opt.jpg"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/color_palette1-opt.png" alt="Color Palette" width="500" height="315" /></a><br /><em>The &#8216;Color Palette&#8217; panel.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Selector” tab</strong><br />This allows you to choose between different color models and select colors using an Adobe-like color picker, instead of the default color cubes swatches. The available options include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_color_spaces_and_their_uses">HSV, HSL, CMYK and RGB</a>; for most of our redesign work, we used the RGB model.</li>
<li><strong>“Mixer” tab</strong><br />This is great for recoloring artwork and creating color tints. We relied on this greatly for stretching the range of our color palette. To try two different palettes in your document, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Click “Palette1” on the left of the panel to set the base colors for the first palette.</li>
<li>Click “Palette2” on the right side of the panel, and then select the base colors for the second palette.</li>
<li>To switch back and forth between the two palettes, select the palette to recolor with and then click the “Replace Color” icon.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>“Blender” tab</strong><br />Here, you can create a color gradation series, which is really handy for exploring gradients. All you have to do is this:
<ol>
<li>Fill the color boxes at the bottom of the panel to select the beginning and ending colors.</li>
<li>Use the “Steps” slider to select the number of steps in the series.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Exporting</strong><br />Exporting any palette out of this panel requires saving it as an <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet-apps/photoshop/fileformatashtml/#50577411_pgfId-1070626">.ACT</a> swatch file, which can be shared with other Fireworks or Photoshop users. Unfortunately, Illustrator cannot open this swatch file format. To share with Illustrator, consider exporting an <a href="http://www.selapa.net/swatches/colors/fileformats.php#adobe_ase">.ASE</a> file via the Swatches panel, which will work across all Adobe products.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The most recent versions of Fireworks (CS5, CS5.1, CS6) all natively support both <code>.ACT</code> and <code>.ASE</code> swatch formats. Earlier versions of Fireworks (CS4 and older) support only <code>.ACT</code>.</p>
<h3>Setting Up The Document For High-Resolution Displays</h3>
<p>Another decision we had to make before starting the visual design process was how to set up our files for high pixel-density (or “Retina”) displays. We could approach this in a few ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with standard-resolution files and scale up for Retina graphics. We opted for this because we were starting from standard-resolution wireframes.</li>
<li>Start with high-resolution files and scale down for non-Retina graphics.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both conversion methods should be quite seamless and yield the same results. Objects in Fireworks are created as vector shapes by default, and any effects applied will also scale (assuming, of course, that you have not created any shapes using filled selections, which were popular in Photoshop prior to the more robust shape layer option available today). All text objects in Fireworks will scale without problems, too.</p>
<h4>Working With Raster Images (Bitmaps)</h4>
<p>Any bitmap images can be replaced with a higher-resolution versions. The key is to always start with high-resolution images where needed and scale down. Below are a few other options to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Image symbols</strong><br />An alternative to replacing your images (and one I highly recommend) is to turn your high-resolution images into symbols (<code>Modify &rarr; Symbol &rarr; Convert to Symbol</code>, or <code>F8</code>) and scale down their placed instances in the layout. Once you turn a raster image into a symbol, you can scale it down to any size and then back up to the original size as many times as you’d like without any loss in quality. If you choose this method, you won’t have to replace your images!</li>
<li><strong>Linked images</strong><br />An option I discovered recently is to link images. This requires installing the free <a href="http://johndunning.com/fireworks/about/LinkedImages">Linked Images</a> extension by <a href="https://twitter.com/fwextensions">John Dunning</a>. With this option, your layouts will be refreshed with the high-resolution images upon being scaled up (the images are stored in a folder outside of the Fireworks file). For a detailed overview of this method, please check the “<a href="http://fireworks.smashingmagazine.com/2013/09/20/fireworks-extensions-for-better-workflow-part-2/#linkedimages">Linked Images</a>” section of “<a href="http://fireworks.smashingmagazine.com/2013/09/20/fireworks-extensions-for-better-workflow-part-2/">Fireworks Extensions for a Better Design Workflow, Part 2</a>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For layout purposes, we used the first option to set image symbols of cars as placeholders. The final car images are generated dynamically on the server and rendered on the live website. We won’t cover this production process in this article.</p>
<p>Hint: A good read on Retina graphics is “<a href="http://retinafy.me">Retinafy Your Websites and Apps</a>” by Thomas Fuchs.</p>
<h3>Live (Pre)View: Bringing Wireframes To Life</h3>
<h4>Live View, Skala Preview and Xscope</h4>
<p>Just as when we were creating the wireframes, we frequently had to check how the mockups looked and scaled on real devices, such as the iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>For quick previews while designing, we turned again to the <a href="http://www.zambetti.com/projects/liveview/">LiveView</a> app (check out <a href="http://fireworks.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/26/mojo-motors-responsive-redesign-with-adobe-fireworks-part-1/">my previous article</a> for details on our process). Alternatives to LiveView are <a href="http://bjango.com/mac/skalapreview/">Skala Preview</a> and <a href="http://xscopeapp.com">Xscope</a>, which provide similar functionality but integrate better with Photoshop. Skala Preview is also compatible with Android devices.</p>
<h4>Bringing Wireframes to Life</h4>
<p>Once the file was set up, the next step was to add pixel precision to the interface and content. This is also when we applied brand elements such as color, typography, iconography and the logo from our style tiles. Putting the pages for each breakpoint in one working file made it easier to transpose screen elements between mobile, tablet and desktop layouts (see part 1 of this series for details on pages, states and symbols in Fireworks).</p>
<h3>Favorite Fireworks Features During The Visual Design Stage</h3>
<p>In this next part, we’ll cover some Fireworks features, tools and workflows that really came in handy during the visual design stage.</p>
<h4>Properties Panel (Property Inspector Panel)</h4>
<p>A lot of great features in Fireworks make creating screen graphics fast and efficient, but the single most powerful UI feature for us was the contextual <strong>direct editing of objects</strong>, available via the Properties panel (also called the Property Inspector (or PI) panel). This powerful panel changes contextually based on the type of object selected on the canvas.</p>
<p>The Properties panel is normally found at the bottom of the screen when a document is first opened in Fireworks. It allows you to manage all attributes, such as fills, strokes, gradients, patterns, textures, size, position, scale, opacity, blend modes, live filters, text properties, masks (and masks properties), symbols and much more, for any selected object or group of objects.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Property_inspector_context_lg-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Property_inspector_context_sm-opt.png" alt="Property Inspector" width="500" height="269" /></a><br /><em>In these three sample screenshots, you can see how the Properties panel adapts to the type of object selected. (<a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Property_inspector_context_lg-opt.png">View large version</a>)</em></p>
<p>Once you understand how the Properties panel works, quickly inspecting and changing the properties of all types of objects with pixel-level precision become really easy. You might also find that making changes is a lot faster than in any other graphics application (including Sketch!).</p>
<h4>Gradients</h4>
<p>Creating gradients is quite simple and intuitive. Adjusting and changing the fill type can be easily done at any time. Fireworks also offers 12 gradient types out of the box. And the dither option reduces banding when images are exported.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gradients_panel_lg-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gradients_panel_sm3-opt.png" alt="Gradient Selector" width="500" height="458" /></a></p>
<p>Side note: Starting with CS6, Adobe added some similar features to Photoshop, including the ability to add fills and strokes to shape layers as an alternative to live filters such as gradient overlay effects. Unfortunately, you can’t change the fill type as easily once you have committed to a gradient or any other type. Changing the fill type requires selecting the shape layer with the Path Selection tool, which will reveal your options in the options bar (in CS6) or in the Properties panel (in CC), at which point you can make your changes.</p>
<h4>Textures</h4>
<p>In addition to applying fills to vector objects in Fireworks, you can add textures to any fill type or stroke. Being able to apply textures to strokes is really useful for simulating CSS border-image effects, which is now supported by most modern browsers. Other features include being able to use your own texture files and specifying the opacity level.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/textures_menu_A_lg-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/textures_menu_A-opt.png" alt="Textures Menu" width="500" height="320" /></a><br /><em>Apply textures with (again!) the mighty Properties panel.</em></p>
<p>If you plan on using textures a lot, the free Texture Panel extension by <a href="http://fireworks.smashingmagazine.com/author/matt-curtis/?rel=author">Matt Curtis</a> is a good addition to Fireworks. For details on this extension, check out Matt’s article, “<a href="http://fireworks.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/14/texture-panel-adobe-fireworks/">Using the Texture Panel in Adobe Fireworks</a>.”</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/texture_panel_A-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/texture_panel_A-opt.png" alt="Texture Panel" width="500" height="380" /></a><br /><em>Texture Panel extension.</em></p>
<h4>Fireworks Live Filters and Photoshop Live Effects</h4>
<p>Fireworks comes with most of the important non-destructive effects that you will need to bring screen designs to life, and it includes some familiar Photoshop live effects as options. I typically opt for Fireworks’ native filters before considering the Photoshop ones.</p>
<p>Fireworks’s live filters can be applied to any type of object (vector, bitmap, symbol, etc.) non-destructively, and the stacking order of applied live filters may be changed simply by dragging and dropping. Another key feature is the ability to apply <strong>multiple filters of the same type</strong> to a single object.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/filters_applied_lg-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/filters_applied_sm-opt.png" alt="Fireworks Live Filters" width="500" height="449" /></a><br /><em>Fireworks’ live filters in the Properties panel.</em></p>
<p>I find the native filters to be quite adequate for most tasks, and I need to switch to Photoshop only for complex compositing, correcting photo colors and creating textures.</p>
<h4>Blend Modes</h4>
<p>Blend modes in Fireworks are similar to Photoshop’s and Illustrator’s. For a long time, Fireworks was the only Adobe application that allowed you to apply blend modes to multiple selected objects (or layers) at once. (Similar features were introduced to Photoshop in CS6. Illustrator requires the opacity option to be edited in the Appearance or Transparency panel.)</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/blendmodes-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/blendmodes-opt.png" alt="Blend Modes" width="500" height="553" /></a><br /><em>Blend Modes may be modified in the Layers panel (top screenshot) and in the Properties panel (bottom screenshot).</em></p>
<h4>Pasting Attributes</h4>
<p>Copying and pasting attributes (using the simple <code>Control/Command + C</code> and <code>Control/Command + Alt + Shift + V</code> shortcuts) between objects is an awesome feature and a huge timesaver, one we often leveraged during the process of going from wireframes to visual comps. Unlike copying and pasting layer styles in Photoshop, Fireworks transfers all attributes &mdash; including font type, font size, fill type, stroke type, applied live filters and so on &mdash; from one selected object to another.</p>
<p>Pasting attributes can even be done selectively (see the “Paste Selective Attributes” section of “<a href="http://fireworks.smashingmagazine.com/2013/09/20/fireworks-extensions-for-better-workflow-part-2/">Fireworks Extensions for a Better Design Workflow, Part 2</a>”), which makes the feature even more powerful.</p>
<h4>Styles and the Styles Panel</h4>
<p>While being able to copy and paste attributes is very useful, using Fireworks’ styles is a lot more efficient and an essential part of creating visual mockups.</p>
<p>Styles in Fireworks are analogous to CSS in Web design. They can be quickly applied to objects on the screen to mock up variations or can be used to apply a final style guide for brand consistency. Whenever a style definition changes, all objects that have the same style are updated automatically.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/styles_button_panel_lg_A-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/styles_button_panel_sm_A-opt.png" alt="Styles Panel large" width="500" height="297" /></a><br /><em>Apply styles via the Styles panel from the built-in library.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/styles_menu_A-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/styles_menu_A-opt.png" alt="Styles Menu in Property Inspector" width="500" height="202" /></a><br /><em>Apply styles via the Properties panel.</em></p>
<p>Style can be created and managed in both the Styles panel and the Properties panel. As a bonus, Fireworks ships with a large library of premade styles that can be applied very quickly to any mockup. You can also easily create, edit and reuse your own styles.</p>
<h4>Rounded Rectangles</h4>
<p>Creating (and modifying) rounded rectangles is very easy, and Fireworks is the most flexible here of the three Adobe applications typically used for screen design (the other two being Photoshop and Illustrator). Create one by modifying the roundness of a rectangle shape (i.e. the border-radius of each corner) directly in the Properties panel or by inserting a rounded rectangle auto shape.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/rounded-rectangles-lg-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/rounded-rectangles-sm-opt.png" alt="Rounded rectangles" width="500" height="323" /></a><br /><em>You can control the roundness of a rectangle’s corners in one of two ways. (<a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/rounded-rectangles-lg-opt.png">View large version</a>)</em></p>
<p>My preference is to use the Properties panel because you can specify the roundness in percentages or pixels. But modifying the roundness at any time is easy either way. You can also modify individual corners of a rounded rectangle. When you’re using the Rounded Rectangle auto shape, the roundness can be also controlled with the Auto Shape Properties panel.</p>
<p>(Photoshop CC just added an option to apply rounding to individual corners of a rectangle or to a rounded rectangle shape layer via the Properties panel. This is a welcome change and a great alternative to adding rounded corners as an appearance effect in Illustrator.)</p>
<h4>Multi-Border Rectangle Auto Shape</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://johndunning.com/fireworks/about/MultiBorderRect">Multi-Border Rectangle</a> auto shape is an extension by John Dunning that makes it easy to mock up CSS-style borders on vector rectangles. You can specify a different border width and color for each of the four borders of a rectangle, just as you do with CSS for each border of an HTML element. This extension proved very useful during our visual design process.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/multi-border_autoshape_lg-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/multi-border_autoshape_sm1_A-opt.png" alt="Multi-border autoshape" width="500" height="623" /></a><br /><em>We used the Multi-Border Rectangle auto shape to add top and bottom borders to rectangles.</em></p>
<h4>Path Panel</h4>
<p>Fireworks has an easy to use and robust set of vector-editing tools, with many of the same features found in Illustrator. Most of the tools can be accessed from the Path panel (and a few are in the “Modify” menu). In CS6, some of the basic path tools were added to the Properties panel, for easy access.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a <a href="http://fireworks.abeall.com/extensions/panels/Path/">more recent version of the Path panel</a> (with many additions and improvements) than the one that ships with Fireworks CS6. (In case you’re wondering, <a href="http://fireworks.abeall.com">Aaron Beall</a> is the talented developer responsible for the latest versions of the Path panel in Fireworks, including the one in CS6.)</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Path_panel_A-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Path_panel_A-opt.png" alt="Path Panel" width="500" height="350" /></a><br /><em>The &#8216;Path&#8217; panel.</em></p>
<h4>Importing From and Exporting to Illustrator</h4>
<p>Fireworks handles <code>.AI</code> files very well, and we used it whenever we had to work with vector art created in Illustrator or in Illustrator-compatible applications. As part of the importing process, you are even presented with a “Vector File Options” window, giving you the option to select a specific Illustrator artboard to import.</p>
<p>We especially took advantage of this workflow with our company’s logo and illustrations throughout the website. Our freelance illustrator worked in Illustrator and imported directly into our Fireworks layouts. For smaller artwork, you could also copy a single object or group of objects in Illustrator and then paste them directly in Fireworks.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/illustrator_import_lg-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/illustrator_import_sm_A-opt.png" alt="Illustrator Import to Fireworks" width="500" height="750" /></a><br /><em>The illustration for Mojo Motors’ “Tour” page was created in Illustrator and then imported into Fireworks, with all vectors perfectly preserved and editable. (<a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/illustrator_import_lg-opt.png">View large version</a>)</em></p>
<p>Exporting vector objects to Illustrator for further refinement is as easy as selecting the object (or group of objects) in Fireworks, then going to <code>Edit &#8594; Copy as Vectors</code>, and then pasting the vector objects in Illustrator. (Simply copying and pasting objects would put bitmap objects in Illustrator, instead of vectors, so always go to <code>Edit &#8594; Copy as Vectors</code>, instead of <code>Edit &#8594; Copy</code>.)</p>
<p>To export large artwork in Fireworks, save the entire file as an <code>.AI</code> file and then open that <code>.AI</code> file in Illustrator.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In Illustrator CC, Adobe removed the importing and exporting options described above. If you are using Illustrator CC, you might need to save your files as “Illustrator v. CS6” to take advantage of all of these capabilities, or work in Illustrator CS6 or lower, which supports all of these options out of the box.</p>
<h4>Importing From and Exporting to Photoshop</h4>
<p>Importing and exporting with Photoshop is a breeze with Fireworks &mdash; Fireworks can save to <code>.PSD</code> and also open <code>.PSD</code> files. In both cases, layers and naming conventions will be preserved.</p>
<p>The results will vary according to the options you’ve set during the importing or exporting process and how much editability you would like to retain. My suggestion is to experiment a little to see which settings work best for your purpose.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photoshop-import-and-open_lg-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photoshop-import-and-open_sm-opt.png" alt="Photoshop import and open." width="500" height="910" /></a><br /><em>The Photoshop importing and file-opening dialogs in Fireworks.</em></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> As of the time of writing, Photoshop importing and exporting still works well in Photoshop CC and CS6.</p>
<h4>Align Panel</h4>
<p>If you intend to create pixel-precise layouts, then you cannot do without the Align panel. With it, you can align multiple objects to each other or relative to the canvas. (Adobe Illustrator has a similar feature, and it was just introduced to Photoshop CS6 as well, although its functionality is not as robust.)</p>
<p>Two useful features that are unique to the Align panel in Fireworks are the “Match Size” and “Space Evenly” options.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/align_panel-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/align_panel-opt.png" alt="Align Panel" width="500" height="366" /></a><br /><em>The &#8216;Align&#8217; panel.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Match size</strong><br />This option lets you match the size of the selected object to the height or width (or both &mdash; but usually the longer dimension) of another object.</li>
<li><strong>Space evenly</strong><br />This is different than distribution, enabling you to align objects a fixed distance apart.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Align panel is invaluable. The only option that I wish Fireworks had adopted from Illustrator is the alignment object reference, which enables you to pick the object to align your selection to.</p>
<h4>Symbols</h4>
<p>During the visual design process, we continued to look for opportunities to modularize interface components by creating <strong>reusable symbols</strong>. In some cases, we simply applied visual styles to existing wireframe symbols.</p>
<p>Styled component symbols are very efficient and reduced the time we took to create alternate layouts and iterations. For details on creating symbols, read the section “Creating Reusable Modular Elements” in <a href="http://fireworks.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/26/mojo-motors-responsive-redesign-with-adobe-fireworks-part-1/">part 1 of this series</a>.</p>
<h4>9-Slice Scaling</h4>
<p>The 9-Slice Scaling tool is original to Fireworks and was adopted later by Flash and recently by Illustrator. With it, you can scale objects without distorting <strong>protected areas</strong>. A popular use of the tool is to protect rounded corners in a symbol when scaled.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/9-Slice_Guides_lg-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/9-Slice_Guides_sm-opt.png" alt="9-Slice Guides (UI button)" width="500" height="721" /></a><br /><em>Use the 9-Slice guides to preserve rounded corners in a button.</em></p>
<p>The 9-Slice Scaling tool works on symbols and on both vector and bitmap objects, making it extremely versatile.</p>
<h4>Single-Layer Editing</h4>
<p>This feature is really geared to designers who are coming to Fireworks from Photoshop and who are used to selecting layers before working on them. I personally prefer the default auto layer selection method in Fireworks because it is faster, especially in files with a ton of layers.</p>
<p><a href="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SingleLayer_editing_A-opt.png"><img src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/SingleLayer_editing_A-opt.png" alt="Single layer editing mode" width="500" height="550" /></a><br /><em>The single-layer editing option in the Layers panel menu.</em></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I was really torn about whether this article would still be relevant in light of the announcement that Fireworks has been <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/fireworks/2013/05/the-future-of-adobe-fireworks.html">feature-frozen</a>. However, as I explored all of the alternative ways to make one’s workflow efficient, I realized that Fireworks is still powerful and will continue to be the best option until Adobe unveils its replacement or until another competitor supports all of its features, including integration with other Adobe products, as Fireworks currently provides. (In my opinion, Photoshop and Illustrator have recently gained some sorely needed features that make the process of designing for screens more efficient, but they’re not there yet.)</p>

<h4>Alternatives?</h4>
<p>Are there alternatives to Fireworks? Of course.</p>
<p>For example, for teams comfortable stepping outside of the Adobe world, the Mac-only <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> is a great replacement, and I hope to see it integrate more of the time-saving features offered by Fireworks. Read about some of the benefits of using Sketch for UI design in the following articles:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<a href="http://medium.com/design-ux/c59ff242715d">It’s Time to Dump Photoshop and Embrace Sketch</a>,” Baz Deas</li>
<li>“<a href="http://medium.com/design-ux/25545f6cb161">Discovering Sketch</a>,” Jean-Marc Denis</li>
</ul>
<p>Sketch doesn’t totally replace Fireworks, but it’s getting pretty close in my opinion. (Craig Erskine, who uses both Sketch and Fireworks, has <a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/1434819/">shared his thoughts</a> on the matter.)</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, I am quite excited about applications such as <a href="http://macaw.co">Macaw</a>, which are embracing a more modern approach to designing for screens with a native desktop application. I recently supported Macaw’s Kickstarter effort and am currently trying out the product with my early-bird license. (The product will launch sometime in March or April 2014.)</p>
<p>Another noteworthy project is Evolve UI, a somewhat secret yet exciting initiative by <a href="http://tribaloid.com">Tribaloid</a> and one that could shake up our workflow in the next few years. Evolve UI is being developed by Alan Musselman, who worked as Fireworks’ project manager for quite some time, and it is currently in <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/underdog-discussions">alpha development</a>.</p>
<h4>Awards</h4>
<p>Last but not least, I’d like to mention that Mojo Motors’ redesigned website received quite a few awards after it launched &mdash; namely, the Web Marketing Association’s <a href="http://www.webaward.org/winner.asp?eid=19327#.UxnW9dzWJ7G">WebAward for 2013</a>, the <a href="http://www.interactivemediaawards.com/winners/certificate.asp?param=283891&#038;cat=1">Interactive Media Award for 2013</a> and the Automotive Website Awards’ <a href="http://www.automotivewebsiteawards.com/20140124-mojo-motors-named-a-rising-star-at-2014-awas/">Rising Star award for 2014</a>. I feel very proud of the work we did on this project. Fireworks was invaluable to our team, minimizing the production work and freeing us to focus on designing a good product for our users.</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>All of the screenshots of Mojo Motors’ website are from the initial launch state at the end of 2012. Some of the screenshots in this article might not match the current website because pages are frequently optimized according to analytics, user testing and performance.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve searched recently for tips on optimizing WordPress’ performance, then you have definitely come across various techniques that people recommend. These include all sorts of caching mechanisms, such as reverse proxies, object caching and cache plugins, CSS minification, using sprites for images, and so on. All of them are <strong>viable and effective ways to speed up a WordPress website’s performance</strong>. However, be careful when implementing any of these techniques, and always test their effect on your particular website.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll cover some of the most common issues with various speed boosters that I have encountered and share solutions to help you fix those problems or find ways around them.</p>
<h3>Possible Problems When Using Reverse Proxies Such As Varnish And Nginx</h3>
<p>I will start with the reverse proxies because, when used correctly, they can give you the biggest speed boost and, when used improperly, can cause serious problems, such as making your website inaccessible or showing the wrong information to the wrong visitors.</p>
<h4>How Do Reverse Proxies Work?</h4>
<p>Reverse proxies, like Varnish and Nginx, stand between your visitors and your Web server. When a request for one of your pages is made, your Web server usually has to execute the PHP service that makes calls to the database and then provides the page output and the static resources needed to visualize the page. With a reverse proxy enabled, this result is cached, and the next time someone requests that page, the ready output will be delivered by the reverse proxy, which is much faster and causes no load on your server.</p>
<p>This is great, but to operate correctly, the cache must be purged every time something on the page has changed. <strong>This is where things can go wrong</strong>, mostly because WordPress does not natively support reverse proxies and requires additional tweaks for the cache to be cleared correctly. Usually, such tweaks rely on WordPress’ default core hooks (think of them as events) to purge the cache when necessary &mdash; when a post is updated, when a comment is added, when a post is created, etc. However, if an important hook is missed in the implementation of the reverse proxy that you’re using, then you might have a problem. Additionally, numerous events &mdash; ones not a part of WordPress’ core hooks but rather performed through plugins &mdash; could change the content on your website.</p>
<h4>Possible Problems During WordPress Updates</h4>
<p>When updating, WordPress puts your website in maintenance mode, updates its files and then disables maintenance mode. The reverse proxy could possibly cache some of your pages while your website is in maintenance mode. This means that if the cache is not purged, then this maintenance page would continue being served to visitors, actively preventing them from reaching your website even when it is operational on the Web server.</p>
<p><strong>When you update a plugin, WordPress disables it</strong>, deletes its entire folder and then adds the new files. During that time, the plugin does not actually work. If it’s a big plugin that adds a lot of functionality, such as a gallery or online store, then your reverse proxy could cache pages with errors on them, instead of the actual content.</p>
<p>When you update manually, the easy fix is either to disable the cache during the update or to purge the cache manually once you are ready with the update. However, when you use WordPress’ native automatic update, these solutions are not very practical. What a good reverse proxy should do instead is <strong>automatically purge the cache on each update event</strong>. Because both core and plugin updates have hooks in the core, this is easily achievable and should be done by you (if you are implementing the reverse proxy yourself) or by your hosting provider (if you rely on the host’s implementation).</p>
<h4>Problems With Online Store Plugins for WordPress</h4>
<p>No matter which WordPress plugin you use for your online store, you should be very, very careful when implementing reverse proxy caching.</p>
<p>For example, you could create a lovely mess with a shopping-cart widget that displays the products that a customer has selected to buy. If that content is cached by the reverse proxies, then all of your visitors would see the products that the first customer has selected for purchase. Things could get even worse if pages containing personal information, such as thank-you pages, are cached and displayed incorrectly to the wrong visitor. Needless to say, this should be avoided at all costs.</p>
<p>The safest way to avoid such problems is to <strong>exclude the entire e-commerce part of your website from the cache</strong>. Usually, reverse proxies implemented by hosting companies exclude the most common WordPress e-commerce plugins from the cache by default.</p>
<p>If excluding the whole e-commerce part of your website does not sound to you like an elegant solution &mdash; because you would obviously lose the speed benefits &mdash; then, theoretically, there is a more intricate way around: using Edge Side Includes (ESI) to specify that parts of your pages should not be cached. In theory, you would simply surround your HTML with ESI tags:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">
&lt;esi:include&gt; Dynamic content &lt;esi:remove&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Then, the content between those tags would be dynamically retrieved every time this page is requested.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, implementing ESI with WordPress is not straightforward at all, due to WordPress’ lack of native support for reverse proxies. Thus, ESI is usually not a viable option with hosts that support reverse proxies. But it is worth considering if you have an online store built with WordPress and you are implementing the reverse proxy yourself.</p>
<h4>Problems With Rating Plugins</h4>
<p>When you use a rating plugin on a WordPress website that is cached by a reverse proxy, chances are that visitors will often see an incorrect cached rating, instead of the real up-to-date rating. The reason is that a visitor’s vote given through such a plugin is not part of WordPress’ default hooks and will not trigger a cache purge.</p>
<p>Similar to the e-commerce issues, you could either exclude pages that you collect rankings for from the cache or implement the ESI model for those pages, if feasible.</p>
<h3>Issues With Full-Page Caching Plugins</h3>
<p>In case your hosting provider doesn’t provide you with a reverse proxy caching service, you could rely on one of the so-called full-page caching plugins for WordPress. When a visitor requests a page, the plugin would save the actual HTML output in a physical file on your server. The next time someone requests that page, it would be served as a static HTML file, which is much slower than a reverse proxy but still faster than not caching at all.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the caching technique being used, all of the possible problems I’ve explained for reverse proxies hold true for the full-page caching plugins, plus some new ones.</p>
<p><strong>Be careful using such caching</strong> on a website with many posts or pages. When you create content on a WordPress website, more pages are automatically created than just the one you’re working on directly: category pages that list all posts in that category, tag pages, archives, author pages, pages for uploaded images, etc. All of these add up to a big number of URLs that your website serves. Now, imagine all of those URLs being turned into HTML files in some folder (usually the <code>uploads</code> folder) on your Web server.  When thousands of files are in a single directory, even listing those files is difficult, and we’re talking about the Linux OS here. The result for a big website is usually a huge number of files, a heavy I/O load on the server and, eventually, a slower website and problems with the hosting provider.</p>
<p>There is no exact number of posts above which you should not incorporate this method, and it also depends on the particular way the plugin stores the cache &mdash; using multiple folders instead of one, for example, would be more efficient, but still might not be enough for a really large website. Just bear in mind that if you use such a caching technique and your website starts slowing down, then this might be the reason.</p>
<h3>Object Caching (Memcached) And How To Break It</h3>
<p>Object caching is great for a website that gets a lot of requests to its database, and it can really speed up some websites. Memcached stores the result of the most commonly executed queries to your database in the server’s RAM and serves the cached results instead of querying the MySQL server each time. Unfortunately, in some scenarios, you could actually decrease your website’s performance, and here is why.</p>
<p>Some WordPress plugins are coded (badly) to store a huge amount of data in the application database. The Memcached service has a limited amount of memory for caching. Imagine what happens when a plugin stores huge images in the database. Memcached will try to store the result of this query in its buffer but will run out of space. Then, it will start to delete previously cached content on a first-in, first-out basis. If the query’s results are big enough, then no actual content would be cached because it would be removed before being served a second time. <strong>In this case, your website would actually slow down</strong> because not only would you fail to spare this load on the MySQL service, but you would add another service in the process that requires its own computing time.</p>
<p>If you find your website is working more slowly after enabling Memcached, then unfortunately your only solution is either to disable all plugins that store a huge amount of data in the database or to disable the Memcached service itself.</p>
<h3>Sprites: Yes, You Can Go Wrong With Them, Too</h3>
<p>I love sprites for the performance boost they give to a website when used correctly. This is why, when we redesigned <a href="http://www.siteground.com/">SiteGround</a> recently, we moved all navigation and UI elements and many other page elements to sprites. Our website became much faster, and we were quite happy with the result. Then, we continued adding elements to the sprite image, until at some point we noticed problems when some pages loaded on iOS devices.</p>
<p>This happened because we hit mobile Safari’s limit on the maximum number of decoded pixels that can be displayed. This limit is different for different devices. You could easily <strong>generate a sprite with a lot of pixels</strong>, and if it reaches the size limit, then the browser won’t load it, which will leave your website without all of the elements contained in that sprite. Of course, you don’t want this to happen.</p>
<p>A good man by the name of William Malone has crafted a <a href="http://www.williammalone.com/articles/html5-javascript-ios-maximum-sprite-frames/">nifty tool</a> to check whether a sprite image will display correctly on all iOS devices. Enter the dimensions of your sprite image in the calculator, and the answer will appear.</p>
<p>If your sprite is too big, a possible solution is to split it into two images. If you have to do this, my advice is to relegate only the newest elements to a new image; otherwise you would have to adjust all of the CSS code that uses the sprite, a task that you’d want to avoid if possible.</p>
<h3>Risks With CSS And JavaScript Minification</h3>
<p>CSS and JavaScript minification is another of the most common techniques for speeding up a website. Generally, minifying these files entails removing all unnecessary symbols (new lines, semicolons after the final CSS property, comments, etc.), thus reducing the size of the files. This technique applies not only to WordPress but to any page that uses CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>Many tools and plugins will automatically minify files.</strong> However, some minify more aggressively than simply removing empty symbols. Some tools will rearrange CSS selectors, for example, grouping them by property, etc. In some cases, this could break the entire logic of a CSS file and turn your website into something that merely resembles the original.</p>
<p>To avoid such problems, use basic non-aggressive minification tools that remove only unnecessary data from JavaScript and CSS files, without reordering properties. In addition, always keep a copy of your unminified files because, after minification, they will become practically unreadable, making any further changes much harder. I use either a plugin or the online <a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/">FreeFormatter</a>.</p>
<h3>Gzip: Can’t Go Wrong Here, But We Can Do It Better</h3>
<p>Enabling Gzip for WordPress will greatly improve loading speed. Gzip compresses a page’s output and transfers it to the visitor’s browser, like a regular ZIP file, whereupon the browser decompresses and renders it. It’s great because the time a browser takes to decompress archived content is many times less than the time needed to physically transfer the uncompressed content from the server to the browser.</p>
<p><strong>Most WordPress users rely on plugins when they can</strong> &mdash; at least the ones who can’t or don’t want to code &mdash; including for Gzip. Unfortunately, Gzip plugins run through PHP, which, although fast, is not as fast as running directly from the Apache server. All you need to do is install mod_deflate (ask your hosting provider if it is available &mdash; it should be because it is pretty much an industry standard) and add a few lines to your <code>.htaccess</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/plain
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/xml
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/css
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xml
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/xhtml+xml
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/rss+xml
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/javascript
AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE application/x-javascript
</code></pre>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Knowing all of the risks involved in optimizing the speed of your WordPress website should not stop you from experimenting. To achieve the best results, just follow few simple principles: don’t change too many things at once, benchmark your loading speeds, use staging copies when possible, and test the website’s functionality after applying each new technique. In doing so, you will speed up your website without breaking any functionality or causing problems for visitors.</p>

<p>Arabic calligraphy was originally a tool for communication, but with time, it began to be used in architecture, decoration and coin design. Its evolution into these major roles was a reflection of the early Muslims’ need to avoid, as their beliefs required, figures and pictorials that were used as idols before Islam was established in the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>While the Arabic tribes preferred to memorize texts and poetry, the first Muslims tried to document their holy book (Qur’an Kareem) using the scripts that we’ll look at in this article. In order to understand how these scripts developed into the beautiful and complex shapes we know today, we have to understand the history of Arabic calligraphy.</p>
<p>Over the course of their development, the Arabic scripts were created in different periods and locations of the expansive Islamic Empire. There is also a close relationship between each Arabic script and its common usage throughout history. This leads us to the question of why this article is important, especially for non-Arabic speakers, and what information can be gleaned from each script.</p>
<p>Well, understanding the history of each script and how Arabic calligraphy evolved over the history of the Islamic Empire can <strong>expand our visual experience beyond the beautiful glyphs and forms</strong>. Some scripts reflect the time period in which they developed, such as the Musand script, which emerged at an early stage in the history of Arabic calligraphy. Others provide geographical insight into where the artwork was developed, such as the Maghribi script, which distinguishes the artwork and inscriptions of northwest Africa.</p>
<p>Can different scripts tell us more information, such as the geographical area where each was developed? How much is the local culture affected by each script? We will try to answer these questions, while briefly going through the history and style of each script.</p>
<h3>The Early Development Of Arabic Scripts</h3>
<p>Digging deep into the history of the Arabian Peninsula and the origin of the Arabic language, archeologists have found inscriptions that show a close relationship between Arabic scripts and some earlier scripts, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaanite_languages">Canaanite</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabataean_language">Aramaic Nabataean</a> alphabets that were found in the north of the Arabian Peninsula. These inscriptions were date to the 14th century BC.</p>
<p><img width="500" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1-old-scripts.jpg"><br />
<em>Comparison of the old scripts letters (Image source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabataean_alphabet">Wikipedia</a>)</em></p>
<h4>Arabic Musnad</h4>
<p>The first Arabic script, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Arabian_alphabet">Arabic Musnad</a>, which likely developed from the above-mentioned languages, doesn’t have the cursive aesthetic that most people associate with modern Arabic scripts. Discovered in the south of the Arabian Peninsula, in Yemen, this script reached its final form around 500 BC and was used until the 6th century. It did not look like modern Arabic, as its shapes were very basic and resembled more the Nabataean and Canaanite alphabets than the Arabic shapes.</p>
<p><img width="500" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2-arabic-musnad.jpg"><br />
<em>Arabic Musnad script (Image source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Panel_Almaqah_Louvre_DAO18.jpg">Marie-Lan Nguyen</a>)</em></p>
<h4>Al-Jazm</h4>
<p>The first form of an Arabic-like alphabet is known as the <a href="http://arabetics.com/public/html/more/History%20of%20the%20Arabic%20Script_article.htm">Al-Jazm<br />
script</a>, which was used by northern tribes in the Arabian Peninsula. Many researchers think the roots of this script go back to the Nabatean script, and yet the early Arabic scripts also seem to have been affected by other scripts in the area, such as the Syriac and Persian scripts.</p>
<p>The Al-Jazm script continued to develop until the early Islamic era in Mecca and Medina in the west of the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p><img width="500" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/3-aljasm-script.jpg"><br />
<em>Arabic Al-Jazm script (Image source: <a href="http://arabetics.com/public/html/more/History%20of%20the%20Arabic%20Script_article.htm">Saad D. Abulhab</a>)</em></p>
<p>The Al-Jazm script developed into different styles, such as the Hiri, Anbari, Makki and Madani. During this period, some other scripts developed, such as the Ma’il, which is considered the predecessor of the Kufic script. Other scripts did not make it through the development process, such as the Mukawwar, Mubsoott and Mashq (which you can read more about in “<a href="http://people.umass.edu/mja/history.html">The Development of the Arabic Script: A Brief History</a>” by professor M.J. Alhabeeb of the University of Massachusetts Amherst). Usually, these scripts were used before and during the early days of the Islamic Empire in the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<h4>Kufic Script</h4>
<p>Following the Arabic Musnad and Al-Jazm, the Kufic script evolved as the next stage of Arabic calligraphy’s development. Unlike those two old scripts, we can identify known letter shapes in the early development of the Kufic script.</p>
<p>As the Kufic script developed over the 7th century, it played an essential role in documenting the Muslim holy book (Qur’an Kareem). The Kufic script is one of the oldest Arabic scripts that persisted in common use until the 13th century.</p>
<p>Its name refers to the city of Kufa in Iraq, where it first appeared, yet most instances of this script were found nearly a thousand kilometers to the south in Medina in the Arabian Peninsula, where the Prophet Mohammed stayed after moving from Mecca.</p>
<p>In the early stages of its development, the Kufic script did not include the dots that we know from modern Arabic scripts. The letter dots (Nuqat) were added during the later development of this and other scripts. Also, at a later stage, Abul Aswad Al Du’ali (688 CE) and Al Khalil Ibn Ahmed Al Farahidi (786 CE) developed the diacritical marks (Tashkeel) that indicate the vowels of the letters.</p>
<p>If we examine Kufic script inscriptions, we’ll notice particular characteristics, such as the angular shapes and long vertical lines. The script letters used to be wider, which made writing long content more difficult. Still, the script was used for the architectural decoration of buildings, such as mosques, palaces and schools.</p>
<p>These characteristics affected the usability of the script and made it more suitable for architectural and written Islamic titles, instead of long texts.</p>
<p>The Kufic script continued its development through the different dynasties, including the Umayyad (661 &ndash; 750 CE) and Abbasid (750 &ndash; 1258 CE) dynasties. Below are some examples of Kufic scripts and their different developmental stages:</p>

<em>Islamic Derham from the Abbasid period with Kufic scripts on both sides (Image source: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alazaat/6845259489/">Hussein Alazaat</a>)</em></p>
<p>While Kufic has been used for a long time and is one of the more common scripts across the Islamic civilization, some versions of it were developed in particular areas, such as Egypt and Iraq. Understanding how the script developed in different areas and being able to identify each variation of it will help us identify the origins of the artifacts where they appear. Variations and developments of the Kufic script include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The thick Kufic script</strong><br />
This is one of the earliest forms of the Kufic script and was used in the early copies of the Holy Qur’an, known as the Uthman Qur’an.</li>
<li><strong>Magribi Kufic script</strong><br />
This script was used in Morocco and includes curves and loops, unlike the original Kufic script.</li>
<li><strong>Mashriqi Kufic Script</strong><br />
The letters in this script are similar to the original Kufic, with a thinner look and decorative lines.</li>
<li><strong>Piramouz script</strong><br />
This script is another version of the Mashriqi script that was developed in Iran.</li>
<li><strong>Ghaznavid and Khourasan scripts</strong><br />
These two other forms of the Kufic script were developed in Iran. These scripts have the same thickness as the original Kufic script, with long vertical lines and decorative ends.</li>
<li><strong>Fatimid Kufic</strong><br />
This form developed in North Africa, especially in Egypt. It was written in thick lines and short curves.</li>
<li><strong>Square Kufic</strong><br />
This form is very noticeable, with its straight letters and no curves at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an Egyptian citizen, resident in Cairo, I enjoy the Fatimid Kufic as part of my daily life because it can be seen in the architectural decorations on the old Islamic buildings. This script was used with decorative motifs in the characters themselves or as a background. The letters are marked with straight lines and angles, with short curves for some letters at the ends of words. One of the leading scholars and an award-winning researcher in the Fatimid Kufic script is <a href="http://www.aucegypt.edu/fac/Profiles/Pages/BahiaShehab.aspx">Bahia Shehab</a>, Professor of Professional Practice at the American University in Cairo.</p>

<h3>Abbasid Dynasty</h3>
<p>After the Umayyad dynasty came the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate">Abbasid dynasty</a> (750 &ndash; 1258 CE), bringing advancements to Arabic calligraphy. During this period, Thuluth and Naskh were developed. The three calligraphers responsible for these developments were Ibn Muqlah, followed by Ibn Al Bawwab (11th century) and Yaqut Al Musta’simi (13th century).</p>
<p><a href="http://calligraphyqalam.com/people/ibn-muqla.html">Ibn Muqlah</a> restricted the scripts’ proportions to six cursive styles, including the Thuluth, Naskh and Muhaqqaq. These rules are based on four elements: the rhombic dot, the alif, the circle and the similarity system. These changes helped to develop the Kufic script with the cursive styles shown below.</p>

<h4>Thuluth Script</h4>
<p>The name “Thuluth” means one third, which might refer to the size of the pen used to write the script. It is one of the cursive scripts that was commonly used to decorate mosques and different types of texts.</p>
<p>The Thuluth script was first developed in the 11th century during the Abbasid dynasty and was refined by calligrapher Seyh Hamdullah during the Ottoman dynasty. It is the basis of scripts that appear later, such as the Jeli Thuluth, the Naskh and the Muhaqqaq, the last two of which we will cover later in this article.</p>
<p>The Thuluth script is marked by its clear structure and readability, which make it suitable for a number of purposes, even today. The cursive letters and long lines make it easily readable and usable for both titles and long texts.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was used in the Holy Qur’an and in architectural decorations in many regions of the Islamic Empire. Below are some examples of the Thuluth script.</p>

<h4>Naskh Script</h4>
<p>During the same period, the 10th century, another main script was developed. Used to copy books, especially the Holy Qur’an, Naskh, which means “copy,” was later refined by Islamic calligraphy master Seyh Hamdullah (1436 &ndash; 1520) during the Ottoman dynasty.</p>
<p>Known for its readable glyphs, the Naskh was traditionally used for long texts and inscriptions. Its use continues today in the design of printed Arabic books, due to its modern look and cursive letters.</p>

<h3>Safavid Dynasty</h3>
<p>After the Abbasid dynasty, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid_dynasty">Safavid dynasty</a> (1502 &ndash; 1736) was established in Persia and made substantial contributions to Islamic arts and calligraphy. It developed the existing Ta’liq script and produced a more developed version, called Nasta’liq, during the reign of Shah Islma’il and his successor, Shah Tahmasp.</p>
<h4>Ta’liq Script</h4>
<p>The word Ta’liq means “suspension” and was inspired by the shape of the script’s lines, which look hung together.</p>
<p>Widely used for a variety of purposes, such as messages, books, letters and poems, the Ta’liq script was formed during the 11th century, was refined during the 13th century in Persia and is still used today.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the words appear hung together and connect to each other, and the letters are rounded and have a lot of curves. While this makes it less legible, the script is often written with a large distance between lines to give more space for the eye to identify letters and words.</p>
<p>While the spaces between lines are helpful, they consume the page, which is obviously a disadvantage when space is limited or the text is long.</p>
<p><img width="500" src="http://media.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/13-taliq-script.jpg"><br />
<em>Example of Ta’liq script (Image source: <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ta'liq_script_1.jpg">Wikimedia</a>)</em></p>
<h4>Nasta’liq Script</h4>
<p>The Nasta’liq is a refined version of the Ta’liq script, although with elements of Naskh. It developed during the 15th century and continued until the 16th century in Persia and Turkey.</p>
<p>Merging the characteristics of both scripts, such as the short vertical lines of Naskh and the long curved horizontal strokes of Ta’liq, it is still used in Persia, India and Pakistan for writing in Persian, Urdu and Punjabi. In terms of legibility, it’s an improvement on the Ta’liq but harder to read than Naskh.</p>
<p>The letters are a little hooked, similar to those of the Ta’liq script, and vary in thickness. Although the arrangement of letters flows smoothly and in harmony, it is hard to write and is less readable than many other scripts. Both  the Ta’liq and Nasta’liq scripts have left their mark on Persian art and architecture, and you can easily identify Persian inscriptions by the type of scripts they’re written in.</p>

<h3>The Maghribi (North Africa)</h3>
<p>Maghrib refers to the west side of North Africa in the Islamic Empire. This area is distinguished by the Maghribi script, used in writings, inscriptions and monuments. The Maghribi script developed during the 10th century and is still used today in Spain and western North Africa, particularly in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. In this way, the Maghribi script drifted away from the scripts discussed above that developed in the Middle East and Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p>The Maghribi script is marked by descending lines written with very large bowls and by letters of a unified thicknesses. The special form of its letters gives it a unique beauty and makes it easy to read, even in long text. Because of its decorative appearance, The Maghribi script is suitable for decorations as well as titles.</p>

<h3>Ottoman Dynasty</h3>
<p>During the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> (1444 &ndash; 1923), Arabic calligraphy went through a noticeable evolution, not only because of the development of a new script but also because of the enhancement of existing scripts. Most Arabic scripts reached their final and modern form during the period between the 15th and 19th centuries. The Ottoman reign is considered a remarkable period in the development of Arabic calligraphy, second only to the Abbasid dynasty.</p>
<p>Throughout the four centuries of the Ottoman Empire, many scripts were developed, such as Diwani, Riq’a, Jeli Dewani, Tughra’a and Siyaqat. Many calligraphers contributed to this development of Arabic calligraphy, including Mustafa Halim (died 1964), Nejmiddin Okyay (died 1976) and Hamid Aytac Al-Amadi (died 1982).</p>
<p>We’ll cover two commonly known scripts from this era, the Diwani and Riq’a scripts.</p>
<h4>Diwani Script</h4>
<p>The name of this script derives from “Diwan,” the name of the Ottoman royal chancery. It was used in the courts to write official documents. Developed during the 16th century, it reached its final shape in the 19th century and is still used today.</p>
<p>It is defined by its beautiful curved letters, merged to form complex shapes and decorative forms. This complexity makes it harder to use with long text, so a simpler version of the script is needed if a calligrapher is to use it for that purpose.</p>

<h4>Riq’a Script</h4>
<p>As we’ve seen, the names of some scripts come from the geographical area where they developed. In this case, the name “Riq’a” derives from how the script was used: written on small pieces of paper or cloth. It seems to be one of the more recent scripts, developed in the 18th century, and is still used today.</p>
<p>The Riq’a script is known for its simple form, making it perfect for paragraphs and long texts. The way its letters are connected makes it particularly easy to convert into a digital font. However, it is not especially attractive in titles or decorations because it does not have the sophisticated letterforms of the Diwani, Thuluth and Kufic scripts.</p>

<h3>Conclusion </h3>
<p>Arabic calligraphy has developed for over 14 centuries in various regions around the world. This history and diversity has enriched Arabic scripts with ever more complex and artistic forms. During this long period, the Baghdadi and Ottoman eras contributed the most to its development.</p>
<p>Arabic calligraphy is still today one of the most widely acknowledged arts and <strong>continues to develop both in traditional methods as well as in digital and computer-generated arts</strong>. Arabic calligraphers from around the world continue to develop their own styles and artwork based on existing scripts and their own letters and scripts. Free modern scripts contribute to the art just as much as traditional scripts have done.</p>
